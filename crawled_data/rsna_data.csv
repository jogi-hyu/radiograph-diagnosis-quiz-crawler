Indirect laryngoscopy revealed a paralyzed left vocal cord. Information from a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck (,Fig 1) was supplemented with magnetic resonance (MR) images (,,,,,,Fig 2). Because the woman had severe congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction of 19%, she and her physician agreed surgery was not the best option.

He was slightly cyanotic. Results of an examination of the chest and cardiovascular system were unremarkable. There was no history of cardiac disease. A chest radiograph showed a few small areas of peripheral airspace opacity. Perfusion lung scintigraphy was performed to assist in the evaluation of pulmonary embolism (,Fig 1) after injection of technetium 99m–macroaggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA) into a right arm vein. Given the findings of this examination, contrast material–enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed on the same day (,,,,Fig 2). A 100-mL dose of iopamidol 300 was injected into a right arm vein at a rate of 4 mL/sec, and image acquisition commenced 20 seconds after the start of the injection. Another episode of pleuritic chest pain prompted another perfusion examination 19 days later. This time, 99mTc-MAA was injected into a left arm vein (,Fig 3).","The first perfusion lung scintigram, obtained after 90 MBq of 99mTc-MAA was injected into a right arm vein, shows activity predominantly in the systemic arterial perfusion territory—particularly in the brain, kidneys, spleen, thyroid, bowel, and myocardium—which indicates a right-to-left shunt (,Fig 1).

An ultrasonographic (US) examination of the gallbladder was performed to evaluate suspected cholelithiasis; this examination revealed gallstones. An abnormal liver was visualized at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This woman had been in good health and had not undergone previous surgical procedures. She had had three normal-term pregnancies and took no regular medications. She had no known exposure to hepatotoxins and had not undergone previous transfusions. There was no history of regular tobacco or alcohol use and no family history of liver disease or familial neoplasia. She had elevated levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (ie, 56 U/L; normal level, 12–31 U/L) and alkaline phosphotase (ie, 708 U/L; normal level, 37–98 U/L). Tumor marker levels—including α-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cancer antigen 19-9 levels—were normal. This patient was referred for further examination. US imaging (,Fig. 1,), including Doppler examination of hepatic vessels, and computed tomography (CT) (,Fig. 2,,) with late hepatic arterial phase and portal phase imaging were performed to allow further evaluation.","US images of the right hepatic lobe (,Fig 1,) demonstrated slightly lobulated confluent hypoechoic lesions that extended to the posterior aspect of the liver capsule.

The results of FDG PET and MR imaging led the orthopedic surgery service to request that the radiology service perform an image-guided percutaneous biopsy of the left distal femoral lesion.","Bone scintigraphy revealed diffuse mildly increased FDG uptake in the medial right thigh that was related to the patient's primary rhabdomyoscarcoma and focally increased FDG uptake in the superior aspect of the distal left femoral medial metaphysis (,Fig 1,). No other areas of abnormal FDG uptake were present. The subsequent FDG PET examination enabled us to confirm the existence of hypermetabolism in both the primary rhabdomyosarcoma and the left femoral metaphyseal lesion, with maximal standardized uptake values (SUVs) of 7.4 and 3.1, respectively (,Fig 2). Physiologic FDG uptake was present elsewhere, with the exception of a right inguinal lymph node (SUV, 2.0; not shown), which demonstrated benign histologic findings at subsequent biopsy. To exclude any soft-tissue abnormality and further evaluate the left femoral lesion, MR imaging was also performed. MR images (,Figs 3,–,5) demonstrated an eccentrically located cortically based lesion with a low T1- and T2-weighted signal intensity rim corresponding to the rim of sclerosis seen on conventional radiographs. The central portion of the lesion demonstrated intermediate T1-weighted signal intensity, high T2-weighted signal intensity, and mild enhancement on T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced images. There was neither an extraosseous extension nor an adjacent soft-tissue abnormality. The remainder of the bone marrow signal intensity was unremarkable.",Nonossifying Fibroma1,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2413040426/asset/images/large/r06dc22g01a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: Anterior 99mTc methylene diphosphonate bone scans of (a) the whole body and (b) the anterior pelvis and proximal legs.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2413040426/asset/images/large/r06dc22g01b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: Anterior 99mTc methylene diphosphonate bone scans of (a) the whole body and (b) the anterior pelvis and proximal legs.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2413040426/asset/images/large/r06dc22g02x.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2: Whole-body FDG PET scans.

Vital signs were remarkable for a blood pressure of 220/170 mm Hg. An unenhanced computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head (,Fig 1) was obtained, and the patient was admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit for further observation.

She did not have back pain or lower limb pain, nor did she have a history of relevant trauma. At the time of presentation, her arterial hypertension and osteoarthritis were being treated. She had a history of localized laryngeal amyloidosis, which was found at 30 years of age and treated with laser excision and tracheostomy. Physical examination revealed mild spasticity and impaired pain and temperature sensation in the right leg. She underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (,Figs 1,–,3), myelography, and postmyelography computed tomography (CT) (,Figs 4, ,5) of the thoracic spine.","MR examination of the thoracic spine revealed anterior displacement of the spinal cord and slight reduction in its anteroposterior diameter at the level of the T5-6 disk. A small part of the spinal cord was seen herniating into the disk space (,Figs 1,–,3). There was an associated widening of the posterior subarachnoid space at this level. On the basis of the MR findings, a diagnosis of transdural idiopathic spinal cord herniation was entertained. This diagnosis was subsequently confirmed with myelography and postmyelography CT. During myelography, the contrast material column posterior to the spinal cord flowed superiorly without a myelographic block. On the lateral thoracic myelogram, a focal discontinuity of the anterior subarachnoid space was noted at the T5-6 disk level. The herniated spinal cord segment could be seen clearly on the axial CT image acquired after myelography (,Fig 4). Sagittal reformations also showed the remodeling of endplates of the T5 and T6 vertebrae (,Fig 5). There was no filling defect or loculation in the subarachnoid space at the level of spinal cord herniation.

There were no bowel or bladder problems. He had an 18-month history of progressive back and bilateral lower limb pain and difficulty walking. (He required rest after walking 100 yards.) He did not have a history of peripheral vascular disease. Relevant medical history included diet-controlled diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for which he had received high-dose inhaled steroids for 4 years prior to admission. He had received oral steroids occasionally but for no more than a few days at a time. Neurologic examination revealed spastic paraparesis and decreased sensation below the T9 vertebra. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the thoracolumbar spine was performed (,Figs 1,, ,2,).","The sagittal T1- and T2-weighted MR images (Fig 1) showed a high-signal-intensity mass in the posterior epidural space that was deeper than 7 mm on the midsagittal section. The mass extended from the level of the T4-5 intervertebral disk to the level of the T8-9 intervertebral disk and had signal intensity similar to that of fat when examined with all sequences; however, specific fat-saturated sequences were not performed. On T1-weighted MR images (Fig 1a), the T6 vertebra was wedged anteriorly and had diffuse low signal intensity. On T2-weighted MR images (Fig 1b), the T6 vertebra had diffuse high signal intensity and a linear horizontal area of low signal intensity above the inferior endplate that was indicative of a fracture with marrow edema; however, there was no associated paravertebral soft-tissue mass that was indicative of a tumor. In addition, sagittal MR images showed probable old fractures of the T7 through T9 vertebrae. These old fractures, together with the probable acute fracture, produced a kyphotic curve of the thoracic spine that appeared to have contributed to spinal cord flattening. This made the spinal cord more vulnerable to compression by the small disk protrusion at the level of the T6-7 intervertebral disk. There were no abnormal signal intensity changes within the spinal cord. The axial T1-weighted MR image (Fig 2a) obtained at the T7 vertebral level and the T2-weighted MR image (Fig 2b) obtained at the level of the T6-7 intervertebral disk showed the homogeneous high-signal-intensity mass occupying the posterior epidural space and compressing and anteriorly displacing the spinal cord. The mass spanned the length of several thoracic vertebrae. In addition, the axial T2-weighted image (Fig 2b) showed the disk protrusion at the level of the T6-7 intervertebral disk compressed the spinal cord and acutely worsened the patient's symptoms.

Physical examination findings were remarkable for bilateral lower extremity weakness. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain was performed (,Fig 1). Initial analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed an elevated nucleated cell count, with 92% lymphocytes (normal range, 37%–75%) and 8% monocytes and/or macrophages (normal range, 0%–15%). CSF staining, cell culture, and polymerase chain reaction results were negative for cryptococcus, histoplasmosis, Coccidioides infection, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, West Nile virus, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. Enzyme immunoassay, Western blot analysis, and indirect immunofluorescence assays were positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies. The plasma HIV RNA level was 32 806 copies per milliliter, and the CD4+ T-cell count was 29 cells per microliter (normal range, 500–1800 cells per microliter). The antitoxoplasmosis immunoglobulin G titer was elevated; however, the immunoglobulin M titer was normal. CSF samples from two lumbar punctures did not show signs of acid-fast bacillus growth; however, an antituberculosis regimen was initiated because of positive purified protein derivative skin test results and positive MR findings. In addition, the patient received a 2-week course of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine to treat toxoplasmosis.","Initial MR imaging of the brain (Fig 1) revealed abnormal T2 hyperintensity and faint contrast enhancement in the right precentral gyrus, bilateral parahippocampal gyri, superior cerebellar vermis, and cerebellar nodules. The ventricular system was normal in size, and there was no dural enhancement. Six weeks later, MR imaging revealed an increase in T2 hyperintensity and enhancement in the right precentral gyrus and cerebral peduncles but decreased T2 hyperintensity and enhancement in the parahippocampal gyri and cerebellum (Fig 2). Seven weeks later, repeat MR imaging revealed multifocal areas of T2 hyperintensity and contrast enhancement involving the right precentral gyrus, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, midbrain, right posterior temporal lobe, and white matter surrounding the lateral and fourth ventricles (Fig 3). Repeat MR imaging 6 weeks later depicted decreased contrast enhancement at all sites (Fig 4).",Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome1,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2512080401/asset/images/large/r09ma01g01x.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: MR images obtained at initial presentation.

In addition, he had an angular face, a protruding chin, irregular alignment of the teeth, frontal bossing, and bulging eyes. He had experienced bilateral mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss since the age of 4 years; this subsequently led to total deafness in his left ear and only residual hearing in his right. (A pure tone audiogram revealed a bone conduction threshold of approximately 50 dB and an air-bone gap of 50 dB.) Furthermore, intermittent headaches, peripheral facial palsy, and recurrent trigeminal neuralgia predominantly localized on the right side became evident early in childhood. During adolescence and adulthood, the patient also reported swallowing difficulties and a mild speech impairment. His stature was normal, and he had never sustained any bone fractures. Previously obtained radiographs revealed symmetric hyperostosis of tubular bones, such as the ulna, radius, metacarpal bones, clavicles, and ribs. Cranial CT and MR images showed generalized thickening of the skull, particularly affecting the vault, petrous bones, and mandible (,Figs 1,,,,–,4,,). Results of laboratory blood tests—including those to assess serum parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and alkaline phosphatase levels—were unremarkable. His IQ was measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and found to be 106 (verbal IQ, 94; performance IQ, 118), which was slightly above average. The patient had two older sisters, one of whom had similar symptoms but in a milder form. The parents were neither affected nor consanguineous.","The cranial CT scout image revealed severe hyperostosis that mainly affected the skull and mandible (Fig 1). The calvarium was as thick as 3.3 cm and consisted entirely of dense bone. Axial CT images of the skull base were obtained with a high-spatial-resolution bone algorithm and depicted extensive sclerosis and hyperostosis of the petrous bones, orbital walls, and calvarium. The latter presented with loss of the diploë mainly due to cortical thickening (Fig 2). The temporomandibular joint was constricted by massive hyperostosis of the condylar processes and the mandibular fossa. Irregular hyperostosis at the level of the foramen ovale could have restricted the mandibular nerve. Similarly, bony narrowing of other neural exit foramina and neural canals could have caused the multiple cranial nerve deficits, such as facial and hypoglossal palsy. Notably, the left external auditory canal was nearly occluded by extensive hyperostosis, despite several attempts to surgically decompress these structures. The internal auditory canals were circumscribed, which caused encroachment of the 7th and 8th cranial nerves. Inner ear structures on both sides of the head appeared to be encompassed by dense bone masses. Bilateral coarsening of the orbital walls reduced the intraorbital volume and resulted in mild proptosis of 13 mm (not shown). However, the optic nerve did not appear constricted. There was considerable signal noise on the CT images obtained with routinely used scanning parameters (100 mAs, 120 kV), a limitation that was most likely caused by the patient's thick bones.",Van Buchem Disease (Hyperostosis Corticalis Generalisata)1,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2513072189/asset/images/large/r09jn02g01x.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Lateral cranial computed tomographic (CT) scout image.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2513072189/asset/images/large/r09jn02g02a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: (a–c) Axial CT images (100 mAs, 120 kV, bone window) of the skull base.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2513072189/asset/images/large/r09jn02g02b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2b: (a–c) Axial CT images (100 mAs, 120 kV, bone window) of the skull base.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2513072189/asset/images/large/r09jn02g02c.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2c: (a–c) Axial CT images (100 mAs, 120 kV, bone window) of the skull base.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2513072189/asset/images/large/r09jn02g03x.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3: Sagittal reconstruction of a three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo cranial 1.5-T T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 2180/3.49; 1-mm section thickness).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2513072189/asset/images/large/r09jn02g04a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4a: Cranial 1.5-T T2-weighted MR images (6990/115) obtained in the coronal plane show (a) distention of the subarachnoid space along the optic nerve sheaths, (b) depletion of the subarachnoid space, and (c) herniation of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum, possibly as a result of increased intracranial pressure.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2513072189/asset/images/large/r09jn02g04b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4b: Cranial 1.5-T T2-weighted MR images (6990/115) obtained in the coronal plane show (a) distention of the subarachnoid space along the optic nerve sheaths, (b) depletion of the subarachnoid space, and (c) herniation of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum, possibly as a result of increased intracranial pressure.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2513072189/asset/images/large/r09jn02g04c.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4c: Cranial 1.5-T T2-weighted MR images (6990/115) obtained in the coronal plane show (a) distention of the subarachnoid space along the optic nerve sheaths, (b) depletion of the subarachnoid space, and (c) herniation of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum, possibly as a result of increased intracranial pressure.'}], [{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2531080011/asset/images/large/r09oc01g01x.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Lateral cranial CT scout image shows generalized thickening of the skull, particularly affecting the vault, petrous bones, and mandible.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2531080011/asset/images/large/r09oc01g02a.jpeg', 'caption': ""Figure 2a: (a–c) Axial CT images (100 mAs, 120 kV) of the skull base and bone window obtained at three levels of the skull base show massive hyperostosis of the skull, orbital walls, and petrous bones.

His wife had recently noticed that he also had some memory impairment. The patient was a dental technician and was still active at work. He had mild hypertension. The only medication he was taking was aspirin (100 mg per day). At presentation, his systolic blood pressure was 160 mm Hg, and his diastolic blood pressure was 80 mm Hg. Funduscopic examination revealed mild arterial narrowing and sclerosis. The patient was alert and perfectly oriented. His Mini-Mental State Examination score was 27 (25.3 after correction for age and education), with some failure on memory tasks. The rest of the neurologic examination was normal. The results of routine blood tests performed at presentation were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate; levels of C-reactive protein and extractable nuclear antigen, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibodies; and prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times were normal. Serum protein electrophoresis findings were negative. This patient was considered to have mild cognitive impairment (amnestic type) and was referred for brain computed tomography (CT) (Fig 1), which was followed the next day by 0.5- and 1.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (Figs 2–4).","Multiple low-attenuation areas in the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres were unexpectedly found at CT (Fig 1). CT also revealed a small well-defined area of low attenuation in the right basal ganglia that was consistent with the appearance of an old infarct (not shown). MR imaging showed that the areas of abnormal signal intensity were asymmetrically distributed, mildly swollen, and more extensive in the posterior parts of the cerebral hemispheres, where they partly involved the cortex (Fig 2). Smaller lesions were present in the subcortical white matter of the orbital and superior frontal gyri. No evidence of hemorrhage was present on CT or T1-weighted MR images. No lesions were seen in the posterior fossa. No abnormal enhancement was seen on postcontrast images (not shown). On diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient maps, the white matter lesions did not show restricted diffusivity and instead were consistent with vasogenic edema (Fig 3). An MR perfusion study revealed decreased cerebral blood volume in the swollen lesions of the white matter and, to a lesser degree, in the adjacent cortex (Fig 3). A T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequence was performed, and it revealed multiple cortical punctate hypointensities due to microhemorrhages, consistent with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (Fig 4). Diagnosis of CAA enabled us to make the final comprehensive diagnosis of CAA-related inflammation. Intramuscular administration of 8 mg/d of dexamethasone in the 1st week and 4 mg/d of dexamethasone in the 2nd week was followed by administration of 50 mg/d of oral prednisone, which was gradually tapered in the following months. Control MR images obtained after 4 weeks of treatment (not shown) revealed dramatic improvement of the white matter lesions. At 6-month follow-up, with prednisone maintenance dosage of 7.5 mg/d, the white matter hyperintensities had almost completely disappeared (Fig 5), and the cognitive profile, as assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination, had returned to a normal score of 30/30.

Subsequently, he contracted an upper respiratory tract infection and developed a cough that produced yellow to brown sputum, a fever of 38.6°C, and shortness of breath. This infection was treated empirically with an oral antibiotic for 5 days, with minor symptomatic improvement. The patient had an unintentional weight loss of 7 kg over the course of 6 weeks and bilateral parahilar air-space opacities on chest radiographs; he was subsequently admitted for further investigation. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) was performed (Fig 1). Except for pancytopenia and a nonspecific lymphoproliferative reaction at bone marrow biopsy, the work-up for possible causes remained inconclusive. The patient was started on multiple antibiotic regimens to cover bacterial or fungal infection because of a fever spike to 40°C and worsening lung involvement at chest radiography (Fig 2).","The initial chest radiograph (not shown) showed nonspecific bilateral parahilar airspace opacities. Contrast material–enhanced thoracic CT (lung window setting) images obtained at admission showed bilateral ill-defined ground-glass opacities and small pulmonary nodules with a predominant peribronchovascular distribution (Fig 1). The pulmonary periphery was relatively spared. Cardiac size was normal, there was no mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement, and there was no pleural or pericardial effusion (images obtained with mediastinal window settings not shown). Repeat anteroposterior portable chest radiography was performed to assess clinical deterioration during the course of admission and revealed progressive, ill-defined, bilateral parahilar airspace opacities (Fig 2). Follow-up thoracic CT (lung window settings) performed while the patient was receiving empirical antifungal treatment revealed bilateral progressive parahilar pulmonary opacities (Fig 3). Although some of the previously present larger ill-defined areas of peribronchovascular opacity had decreased in size, there was an increased profusion of discrete small nodules located diffusely in the central portions of the lungs.

He had traveled abroad 4 weeks earlier. During his travel, he contracted chicken pox. At presentation, the clinical examination revealed no fever; however, the patient had severe headache, flaccid quadriparesis, and anarthria. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed 100 lymphocytes with normal cerebrospinal fluid glucose and protein levels; there was no evidence of bacteria. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain were obtained 7 days after the onset of symptoms (Figure).","T1- (Fig 1a) and T2-weighted (Fig 1b) gradient-echo MR images revealed hypo- and hyperintensity, respectively, in an isolated lesion of the pons. Gradient-echo T2-weighted MR images (Fig 1b) revealed some peripheral areas of hypointensity, which were thought to reflect areas of microhemorrhage. After administration of a gadolinium chelate, the lesion demonstrated ring enhancement (Fig 1c). The center of the lesion was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted MR images (Fig 1d), with a corresponding area of restricted diffusion on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (Fig 1e). 1H MR spectroscopy (Fig 1f) revealed high choline and lipid levels and a reduced N-acetylaspartate level in the center of the lesion.

Prior to hepatic resection, she had presented to a local emergency room with sudden-onset severe right-sided abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) performed at that time for suspicion of a renal stone revealed hepatic masses.","Contrast material–enhanced CT revealed that the portal vein was absent and that the superior mesenteric vein joined by the splenic vein drained directly into the inferior vena cava. Consequently, the hepatic artery was the primary blood supply to the liver. The liver was within normal limits for size and configuration, but multiple hypoattenuating lesions, only a few of which are shown here, were noted scattered throughout both lobes (Fig 1). On MR images, almost all of the lesions were nearly isointense to the liver on unenhanced in-phase gradient-echo T1-weighted images (Fig 2a, 2b) and on T2-weighted images (Fig 3a). On out-of-phase gradient-echo T1-weighted images (Fig 2c, 2d), there was a substantial homogeneous signal intensity decrease in all the lesions, suggesting the presence of intralesional fat. MR imaging performed with a hepatobiliary specific contrast agent, gadoxetate disodium (Eovist; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ), demonstrated that the hepatic masses showed only mild enhancement during the arterial phase on T1-weighted images (Fig 3c); the lesions remained hypointense relative to the liver on 5- (not shown) and 20-minute postcontrast T1-weighted images with little gadoxetate disodium enhancement (Fig 3d).",Congenital Absence of the Portal Vein with Hepatic Adenomatosis,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.11102045/asset/images/large/102045fig01a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: (a, b) Contrast material–enhanced axial CT images obtained in the portal venous phase.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.11102045/asset/images/large/102045fig01b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: (a, b) Contrast material–enhanced axial CT images obtained in the portal venous phase.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.11102045/asset/images/large/102045fig02a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: Fast gradient-echo T1-weighted axial (a, b) in-phase (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 150 /4.5; flip angle, 85°) and (c, d) out-of-phase (150/2.2; flip angle, 85°) MR images.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.11102045/asset/images/large/102045fig02b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2b: Fast gradient-echo T1-weighted axial (a, b) in-phase (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 150 /4.5; flip angle, 85°) and (c, d) out-of-phase (150/2.2; flip angle, 85°) MR images.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.11102045/asset/images/large/102045fig02c.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2c: Fast gradient-echo T1-weighted axial (a, b) in-phase (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 150 /4.5; flip angle, 85°) and (c, d) out-of-phase (150/2.2; flip angle, 85°) MR images.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.11102045/asset/images/large/102045fig02d.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2d: Fast gradient-echo T1-weighted axial (a, b) in-phase (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 150 /4.5; flip angle, 85°) and (c, d) out-of-phase (150/2.2; flip angle, 85°) MR images.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.11102045/asset/images/large/102045fig03a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3a: (a) Fast spin-echo T2-weighted axial MR image (12\u2009000/86.7; flip angle, 90°).

The asymmetry started in her early teens and gradually progressed, with occasional pain. A physical examination revealed that the left side of her face was smaller than the right side, with tightening of her skin and loss of subcutaneous fat. Her left eye was slightly sunken. Left eye visual acuity was normal. There was no facial nerve palsy or trigeminal dysfunction. Mastication was normal. She had no other underlying illness. She was referred for computed tomography (CT). Unenhanced CT of the face was performed, and images were viewed with bone and soft-tissue window settings (Figs 1–3). Volume-rendered reformations (Fig 4) were also obtained.","Unenhanced CT of the face (Figs 1, 2) revealed generalized atrophy of the soft tissues of the left hemiface. The mastication muscles, hemitongue, submandibular and parotid glands, and parapharyngeal and subcutaneous tissues were smaller on the left side of this patient’s face than on the right side. The fat planes on the left side were not as well defined as those on the right. There was overall volume loss on the left side of the patient’s face, with minor leftward deviation of the aerodigestive tract. The nasal septum was deviated to the left with a bony spur (Fig 3). There was loss of subcutaneous fat volume on the left side of the face, the platysma muscle had a relatively thinned appearance, and the left side of the face appeared sunken. The loss of tissue volume was restricted to the left side of the face and did not cross the midline. Maxillary dentition showed slight asymmetry, with posterior nonocclusion on the left side of the face (Fig 4). There were several nonspecific prominent bilateral level 1 and 2 lymph nodes that were not pathologially enlarged by size criteria (1,2).",Parry-Romberg Syndrome,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.11091972/asset/images/large/091972fig01a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: (a, b) Unenhanced axial CT images at level of (a) hyoid and (b) mandible.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.11091972/asset/images/large/091972fig01b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: (a, b) Unenhanced axial CT images at level of (a) hyoid and (b) mandible.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.11091972/asset/images/large/091972fig02a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: (a, b) Unenhanced axial CT images through (a) mandible and (b) maxilla.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.11091972/asset/images/large/091972fig02b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2b: (a, b) Unenhanced axial CT images through (a) mandible and (b) maxilla.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.11091972/asset/images/large/091972fig03a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3a: (a) CT image through maxilla, as viewed with bone window settings.

The patient had a history of hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine leiomyomas, with right broad ligament involvement 1 year previously. Clinical examination and laboratory tests at admission revealed normal findings, including normal serum creatine kinase and troponin levels. Electrocardiography revealed only mild sinus tachycardia, with no features of myocardial ischemia or infarction. The patient underwent diagnostic imaging, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figs 1–Figs 6).","An intravenous hypoattenuating mass originating in the right ovarian vein and extending into the proximal inferior vena cava (IVC) and right atrium is seen on coronal and sagittal reconstructed contrast material–enhanced CT images (Figs 1, 2). The right ovarian vein arises from the suspensory ligament of the ovary within the right side of the pelvis. It extends superiorly into the abdomen anterior to the right psoas muscle and lateral to the right ovarian artery and right ureter. The right ovarian vein then crosses anterior to the ureter prior to entering the proximal IVC at its anterior surface, just inferior to the level of the main renal vessels. The mass is located anteriorly within the lumen of the proximal cava, with no involvement of the main renal veins, as seen on an axial contrast-enhanced CT image (Fig 3). It has heterogeneous T2-weighted hyperintensity and mild patchy enhancement after contrast material administration (as seen on an axial T2-weighted MR image and a coronal fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR image, respectively) (Figs 4, 5). Enhancement of the mass is better appreciated on the MR image than on the CT image. Aside from a simple left renal cyst (Fig 1), the intraabdominal parenchymal organs are otherwise normal on the CT and MR images. Intracardiac involvement in the form of a dumbbell-shaped hypointense mass in the right atrium and right ventricle is seen on an axial fat-suppressed T1-weighted MR image of the thorax (Fig 6).",Intravenous Leiomyomatosis with Intracaval and Intracardiac Involvement,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12111236/asset/images/large/111236fig01.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Coronal oblique reconstructed CT image of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (2-mm section thickness) after administration of intravenous (100 mL of iohexol, Omnipaque 350; GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) and oral (1 L of 9% ioxithalamic acid, Telebrix 38; Tyco Heathcare, Quebec, Canada) contrast media.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12111236/asset/images/large/111236fig02.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2: Sagittal reconstructed CT image of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (2-mm section thickness) after administration of intravenous (100 mL of iohexol) and oral (1 L of 9% ioxithalamic acid) contrast media.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12111236/asset/images/large/111236fig03.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3: Axial CT image of the abdomen (2-mm section thickness) at the level of the renal veins after administration of intravenous (100 mL of iohexol) and oral (1 L of 9% ioxithalamic acid) contrast media.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12111236/asset/images/large/111236fig04.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4: Axial T2-weighted 1.5-T MR image (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 593/44) of the upper abdomen (8-mm section thickness) at the level of the confluence of the right hepatic vein and the inferior vena cava.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12111236/asset/images/large/111236fig05.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 5: Coronal fat-suppressed T1-weighted 1.5-T MR image (3.23/1.43) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (4-mm section thickness) after administration of intravenous contrast material (0.2 mL per kilogram of body weight gadopentetate dimeglumine, Magnevist; Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Leverkusen, Germany).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12111236/asset/images/large/111236fig06.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 6: Axial fat-suppressed T1-weighted 1.5- T MR image (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 159.9/1.08) of the thorax (8-mm section thickness) after administration of intravenous contrast material (0.2 mL/kg of gadopentetate dimeglumine).'}], [{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12111246/asset/images/large/111246fig01.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Coronal oblique reconstructed CT image of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (2-mm section thickness) after administration of intravenous (100 mL of iohexol, Omnipaque 350; GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) and oral (1 L of 9% ioxithalamic acid, Telebrix 38; Tyco Heathcare, Quebec, Canada) contrast media shows a hypoattenuating tubular-shaped mass (curved arrow) originating in the right side of the pelvis within the lumen of the ovarian vein and demonstrating a 30-cm-long contiguous extension into the proximal IVC and right atrium (arrowhead).

The lesion was separated by a thin septum into two components. The more cephalad component showed signal intensity that was nearly identical to that of cerebrospinal fluid on both T1- and T2-weighted images. However, moderately high signal intensity of this component on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images indicated greater complexity of the fluid and, thus, not simple cerebrospinal fluid. The lower component exhibited high signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images, as well as on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, with a fluid-fluid level that indicated blood products.

She reported no relief with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. She also reported chest tightness and dyspnea. She denied fever, nausea, vomiting, unintentional weight loss, or history of trauma to the area. At examination, she was tender to palpation of the left posterior chest wall. She had decreased range of motion in the back, without any loss of strength. Her white blood cell count and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable. Chest radiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the chest were performed. Her pain lessened with narcotic medication (Figs 1–4).","The posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the chest showed a posterior mediastinal mass (Fig 1). Contrast material–enhanced chest CT, ordered by the emergency medicine physicians to work up the abnormal chest radiograph, revealed a paravertebral mass adjacent to the T6 level, encasing the thoracic aorta and abutting the left atrium (Fig 2a). The mass contained internal coarse calcifications in a ring and arc pattern (Fig 2b). The noncalcified portion of the mass was hypoattenuated when compared with muscle, with an average attenuation of 20–35 HU. The mass resulted in cortical destruction of the adjacent thoracic vertebral body and extended into the surrounding soft tissue. The cardiothoracic surgeons and neurosurgeons requested thoracic MR imaging to evaluate involvement of the spine. The mass was heterogeneously isointense to skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images (not shown) and heterogeneously hyperintense to skeletal muscle on T2-weighted images (Fig 3). The MR images also showed bone destruction of the adjacent vertebral body and enabled us to confirm aortic encasement by the tumor. Infiltration into the left atrial wall was not shown; however, evaluation for this was limited by lack of function images. There was heterogeneous contrast enhancement within the mass; this finding is consistent with a vascularized mass (Fig 4). CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of the lesion was performed by using an 18-gauge core biopsy needle, which enabled us to make a definitive diagnosis.",Chondrosarcoma of the Posterior Mediastinum,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12120434/asset/images/large/120434fig01a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: (a) Posteroanterior and (b) lateral chest radiographs.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12120434/asset/images/large/120434fig01b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: (a) Posteroanterior and (b) lateral chest radiographs.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12120434/asset/images/large/120434fig02a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: Transverse CT images of the chest obtained after intravenous administration of 150 mL of iohexol (Omnipaque 300; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis) with (a) soft-tissue and (b) bone window settings.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12120434/asset/images/large/120434fig02b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2b: Transverse CT images of the chest obtained after intravenous administration of 150 mL of iohexol (Omnipaque 300; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis) with (a) soft-tissue and (b) bone window settings.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12120434/asset/images/large/120434fig03.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3: Transverse T2-weighted MR image of the chest obtained with selective fat saturation (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 2550/90.30).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.12120434/asset/images/large/120434fig04.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4: Coronal T1-weighted MR image of the chest with selective fat saturation (550/12.38) after intravenous administration of 15 mL of gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance; Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ).'}], [{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.13120510/asset/images/large/120510fig01a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: (a) Posteroanterior and (b) lateral chest radiographs show a posterior mediastinal mass (arrow).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.13120510/asset/images/large/120510fig01b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: (a) Posteroanterior and (b) lateral chest radiographs show a posterior mediastinal mass (arrow).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.13120510/asset/images/large/120510fig02a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: Transverse CT images of the chest obtained after intravenous administration of 150 mL of iohexol (Omnipaque 300; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis) with (a) soft-tissue and (b) bone window settings show a paravertebral mass (long arrow) associated with the ring and arc pattern of calcifications (short arrow), cortical disruption of the adjacent T6 vertebral body, and encasement of the descending aorta (arrowhead).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.13120510/asset/images/large/120510fig02b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2b: Transverse CT images of the chest obtained after intravenous administration of 150 mL of iohexol (Omnipaque 300; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis) with (a) soft-tissue and (b) bone window settings show a paravertebral mass (long arrow) associated with the ring and arc pattern of calcifications (short arrow), cortical disruption of the adjacent T6 vertebral body, and encasement of the descending aorta (arrowhead).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.13120510/asset/images/large/120510fig03.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3: Transverse T2-weighted MR image of the chest obtained with selective fat saturation (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 2550/90.30) shows that the mass (arrow) is heterogeneously hyperintense and disrupts the vertebral body margin (arrowhead).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.13120510/asset/images/large/120510fig04.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4: Coronal T1-weighted MR image of the chest with selective fat saturation (550/12.38) after intravenous administration of 15 mL of gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance; Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ) shows heterogeneous enhancement of the mass (arrow).'}]]"

Laboratory analysis revealed elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (103 IU/L [1.71 μkat/L]) and alkaline phosphatase (104 IU/L [1.73 μkat/L]) levels. Bilirubin (0.4 mg/dL [6.84 μmol/L]) and transaminase (alanine aminotransferase, 26 IU/L [0.43 μkat/L]; aspartate aminotransferase, 25 IU/L [0.42 μkat/L]) levels were normal. The α-fetoprotein level was normal (3 μg/L). Tests for hepatitis B and C viral markers were negative. The patient had no history of alcoholism. His medical history was marked by a prior right colectomy for fungal infection, lung surgery for a pulmonary abscess, surgery for an inguinal hernia, and diabetes.

A cortical defect within the left renal upper pole (Fig 3) and multiple tumor vessels extending into the renal cortex (Figs 2, 3) were also noted.

She had not experienced any acute change in symptoms, but unspecific unilateral hyperintensities in her left cerebral hemisphere had been noted at a previous MR examination in 2004. Since 2001, she had been repeatedly seen in neurology departments for recurrent episodes of clumsiness of her left hand and frequent headaches. Her other medical history was unremarkable, as were the findings of a neurologic examination. She was not born prematurely, she was not hypertensive, and she had not shown signs or symptoms suggestive of immunincompetence or autoimmune disease. There was no history of meningitis or encephalitis. A source for embolic foci could not be established. Serology indicated no previous cysticercosis infection. Her laboratory test results were normal. Since no other underlying cause had been previously considered, a radiologist from another institute postulated that her left hemispheric hyperintensities could be seen as a rudimentary expression of tuberous sclerosis lacking the classic clinical triad. The MR examination in our institution was performed to rule out progression (Figs 1–3). The resulting images were compared with those obtained in 2004 (Fig 4).","MR imaging, performed with a 1.5-T unit, showed multiple cystic foci on the transverse images; these foci appeared tubular on the coronal images and were located in the cerebral white matter exclusively in the left hemisphere, including the left frontal superior and left frontal inferior gyri, left precentral gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, cingulate gyrus in the left hemisphere, and left putamen. The multiple confluent oval well-defined lesions were isointense to cerebrospinal fluid on coronal T2-weighted images (Fig 1). Some of the lesions were directly adjacent to confluent glovelike hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MR images, without displaying the patchy characteristics of microvascular encephalopathy (Fig 2). There was no evidence of cytotoxic edema on the echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR images (Fig 3).

The movements increased with action, decreased with relaxation, and disappeared during sleep. The patient’s medical history included diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. No history of parkinsonism or other neurologic disorders was reported. Furthermore, the patient had no prior history of dopamine antagonist or estrogen medication use. At admission, she was fully alert and oriented. A physical examination revealed her muscle tone and strength were normal on both sides; however, she reported transient weakness in the right limbs. There was no evidence of sensory impairment, and cranial nerves were normal. The deep tendon reflexes were symmetrically hypoactive. Her skin was pink, warm, and dry. Laboratory tests revealed poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, with a fasting blood glucose level of 410 mg/dL (22.8 mmol/L) and a hemoglobin A1C level of 18.0%. The urine examination was negative for ketones. Shortly after admission, the patient’s blood sugar was controlled with insulin; this led to a steady correction of glycemia in the subsequent days. At admission, the patient underwent unenhanced brain computed tomography (CT) (Fig 1). Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain was performed 2 days later (Fig 2). After she was discharged from the hospital, the involuntary movements progressively decreased over the next few weeks until they disappeared. Two months later, follow-up unenhanced brain CT (not shown) showed the absence of abnormal findings.","Unenhanced CT of the head revealed slight and homogeneous increased attenuation in the left lentiform nucleus (Fig 1a, 1b).

MR imaging of the brain performed 2 days after onset of hemiballism-hemichorea revealed abnormally strong hyperintense signal in the posterior portion of the left putamen on T1-weighted images (Fig 2a) and isointensity on T2-weighted images (Fig 2b). Diffusion-weighted images revealed normal signal intensity in the left putamen (Fig 2c).

The axial images revealed the presence of a T2 hypointense (Fig 1) and T1 hyperintense (Fig 2) retrolental mass anterior to the vertex of the funnel. The morphology of the lens was also abnormal, and it can be seen best in Figure 1. Figure 3 is a composite of noncontrast and postcontrast T1-weighted coronal images obtained through the retrolental tissue and seen anterior to the center of the funnel in Figures 1 and 2, suggesting enhancement.

Initial blood count (performed at an outside hospital) showed elevated white blood cell and platelet counts but low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. On examination, she had adenopathy in the left axillary and supraclavicular regions, fullness in the left chest, and abdominal guarding. Ultrasounography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the left anterior chest wall mass was nondiagnostic, and lumbar puncture and bone marrow biopsies were negative. At that time, the patient underwent several imaging studies—including chest radiography (Fig 1); bone scanning (Fig 2); contrast material–enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig 3); and fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT (Fig 4)—all performed within 1 week of each other.

The technetium 99m (99mTc) methyl diphosphonate bone scan (Fig 2) revealed diffuse linear uptake in the anterior left first and second ribs and diffuse mild soft-tissue uptake in the surrounding left hemithorax; otherwise, there was no scintigraphic evidence of distant metastases in the skeleton. The contrast-enhanced CT images (Fig 3) showed a large heterogeneous mass involving almost the entirety of the visualized portion of the left upper lobe. This mass was further seen to extend directly into the chest wall anteriorly and laterally and into the mediastinum. There was encasement of the great vessels, and the trachea was displaced to the right. Additional lymphadenopathy was seen in the contralateral mediastinum and ipsilateral axilla. The axial section through the abdomen showed a diffusely enlarged pancreas, with loss of normal contours suggesting inflammation. The baseline 18F FDG PET/CT scan (Fig 4) revealed a bulky intensely hypermetabolic mass centered in the left upper lobe and extending into the chest wall and mediastinum and likely into the left lower lobe. There were also multiple additional scattered foci of uptake corresponding to lymph nodes in the neck and supraclavicular, axillary, and mediastinal regions (at a minimum). The axial scan through the abdomen again revealed a diffusely enlarged pancreas associated with moderate diffuse 18F FDG uptake that was suggestive of inflammation. A small area of hypoatenuation in the posterior spleen was also hypermetabolic, suggesting splenic involvement.

There was also an enhancing epidural mass at the T5-6 level that was compressing the spinal cord and was compatible with a diagnosis of epidural phlegmon (Fig 4c).",Disseminated Coccidioidal Spondylodiskitis,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14112330/asset/images/large/radiol.14112330.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: Midline sagittal two-dimensional reformatted unenhanced CT images of the (a) cervical and (b) thoracolumbar spine.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14112330/asset/images/large/radiol.14112330.fig1b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: Midline sagittal two-dimensional reformatted unenhanced CT images of the (a) cervical and (b) thoracolumbar spine.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14112330/asset/images/large/radiol.14112330.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: Midline sagittal (a) T2-weighted (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 3500.0/110.06), (b) T1-weighted precontrast (600.0/7.92), and (c) T1-weighted postcontrast (intravenous gadopentetate dimeglumine, 0.1 mmol per kilogram of body weight, Magnevist; Bayer, Wayne, NJ) (750.0/7.92) MR images at the level of the cervical and upper thoracic spine obtained 2 months after the images in Figure 1.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14112330/asset/images/large/radiol.14112330.fig2b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2b: Midline sagittal (a) T2-weighted (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 3500.0/110.06), (b) T1-weighted precontrast (600.0/7.92), and (c) T1-weighted postcontrast (intravenous gadopentetate dimeglumine, 0.1 mmol per kilogram of body weight, Magnevist; Bayer, Wayne, NJ) (750.0/7.92) MR images at the level of the cervical and upper thoracic spine obtained 2 months after the images in Figure 1.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14112330/asset/images/large/radiol.14112330.fig2c.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2c: Midline sagittal (a) T2-weighted (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 3500.0/110.06), (b) T1-weighted precontrast (600.0/7.92), and (c) T1-weighted postcontrast (intravenous gadopentetate dimeglumine, 0.1 mmol per kilogram of body weight, Magnevist; Bayer, Wayne, NJ) (750.0/7.92) MR images at the level of the cervical and upper thoracic spine obtained 2 months after the images in Figure 1.'}], [{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14112328/asset/images/large/radiol.14112328.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: Axial unenhanced CT images of the chest with lung (a, b) and soft-tissue (c) window settings.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed clear fluid, a normal glucose level (64 mg/dL [3.6 mmol/L]; normal range, 40–70 mg/dL [2.2–3.9 mmol/L]), an elevated protein level (97 mg/dL; normal range, 12–60 mg/dL), and an elevated white blood cell count (7/mm3 [0.007 ×109/L] in tube 1 and 17/mm3 [0.017 × 109/L] in tube 2) with 84% lymphocytes. CSF immunoglobulin G level was elevated (30.1 mg/dL; normal, <5.9 mg/dL); however, there were no oligoclonal bands. Gram staining, acid-fast staining, and lactic acid, cryptococcal antigen, histoplasma antigen, herpes simplex virus polymerase chain reaction, VDRL, and RPR test results for CSF were negative. CSF did not grow any bacteria, fungus, or acid-fast bacillus at culture. CSF flow cytometry did not reveal a monoclonal lymphoid population. Initial imaging included brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (Figs 1–3). Computed tomography (CT) images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were normal (not shown). The patient’s clinical symptoms and imaging findings responded to treatment with a high dose of oral steroids. However, the patient’s symptoms exhibited clinical and radiologic progression after several attempts to taper the steroid dose.","Axial diffusion-weighted sequence and apparent diffusion coefficient map through the level of the pons (Fig 1) revealed no focal or punctate areas of diffusion restriction. Axial T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images through the same level (Fig 2) revealed diffuse patchy hyperintensity at the dorsal pons, medial aspects of the middle cerebellar peduncles, and bilateral medial cerebellum and vermis. There were no punctate foci of hypointensity on T2-weighted images. Contrast material–enanced T1-weighted images (Fig 3) showed numerous punctate foci of enhancement involving the brain stem, middle cerebellar peduncles, and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres distributed in a perivascular pattern. There was no evidence of leptomeningeal enhancement. Distribution of lesions was almost symmetrical.",Chronic Lymphocytic Inflammation with Pontine Perivascular Enhancement Responsive to Steroids,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14131354/asset/images/large/radiol.14131354.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: (a) Apparent diffusion coefficient map and (b) diffusion-weighted MR image (b = 1000 sec/mm2) through the level of the pons.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14131354/asset/images/large/radiol.14131354.fig1b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: (a) Apparent diffusion coefficient map and (b) diffusion-weighted MR image (b = 1000 sec/mm2) through the level of the pons.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14131354/asset/images/large/radiol.14131354.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: (a) Axial fast spin-echo T2-weighted (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 5000/89) and (b) axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (repetition time msec/echo time msec/inversion time mesc, 9002/159.5/2200) MR images obtained through the level of the pons.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14131354/asset/images/large/radiol.14131354.fig2b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2b: (a) Axial fast spin-echo T2-weighted (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 5000/89) and (b) axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (repetition time msec/echo time msec/inversion time mesc, 9002/159.5/2200) MR images obtained through the level of the pons.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14131354/asset/images/large/radiol.14131354.fig3a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3a: Fat-suppressed T1-weighted (a–c) axial (466/9) MR images through the level of the midbrain (a), pons (b), and medulla (c) and (d) coronal image through the cerebellum after intravenous injection of gadoteridol (Pro-Hance; Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14131354/asset/images/large/radiol.14131354.fig3b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3b: Fat-suppressed T1-weighted (a–c) axial (466/9) MR images through the level of the midbrain (a), pons (b), and medulla (c) and (d) coronal image through the cerebellum after intravenous injection of gadoteridol (Pro-Hance; Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14131354/asset/images/large/radiol.14131354.fig3c.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3c: Fat-suppressed T1-weighted (a–c) axial (466/9) MR images through the level of the midbrain (a), pons (b), and medulla (c) and (d) coronal image through the cerebellum after intravenous injection of gadoteridol (Pro-Hance; Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14131354/asset/images/large/radiol.14131354.fig3d.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3d: Fat-suppressed T1-weighted (a–c) axial (466/9) MR images through the level of the midbrain (a), pons (b), and medulla (c) and (d) coronal image through the cerebellum after intravenous injection of gadoteridol (Pro-Hance; Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ).'}], [{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14131355/asset/images/large/radiol.14131355.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: (a) Apparent diffusion coefficient map and (b) diffusion-weighted MR image (b = 1000 sec/mm2) through the level of pons show no areas of diffusion restriction.

The patient denied fevers, night sweats, contact with sick individuals, occupational exposure to infection, bleeding, immunodeficiency, intravenous drug use, alcohol or tobacco abuse, history of malignancy, family history of genetic disorders, and international travel. Physical examination revealed a skin-colored mass protruding from the right side of her forehead, but there were no other notable abnormalities. Her diabetes was managed with diet, and the only prescription medication she was taking was esomeprazole. She was not taking anticoagulants. Initial laboratory work-up revealed anemia and profound thrombocytopenia (hemoglobin level, 9.4 g/dL; platelet count, 16 × 109/L); these were refractory to aggressive treatment, including plasmapheresis, immunosuppression with prednisolone, and numerous transfusions. Contrast material–enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the head was performed at admission to further evaluate the patient’s headache and the mass on the patient’s forehead (Fig 1). Ultrasonography of the abdomen was performed to evaluate the cause of abdominal pain (Fig 2). The discovery of liver lesions at US led us to perform contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figs 3, 4). Contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the abdomen was performed to narrow the diagnostic considerations for the lesions identified at CT (Figs 5, 6). Bone marrow biopsy revealed no evidence of infectious or neoplastic processes. Endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed; however, they revealed no abnormalities. Further laboratory work-up included extensive testing for parasites, fungi, bacteria, and viruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus. All of the results were negative. On the 17th day of admission, the patient became acutely unresponsive, her condition deteriorated rapidly, and she died. Unenhanced head CT was performed at the time of the patient’s acute decompensation (Fig 7).","Figure 1 is an axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR image of the head that was obtained to assess the patient’s initial report of headache and the lesion on the patient’s forehead. There is an extra-axial peripherally enhancing soft-tissue lesion extending through the diploic space and showing mass effect in the right frontal lobe. Figure 2 is a transverse gray-scale US image of the upper abdomen obtained to evaluate the patient’s vague upper abdominal pain. This image shows ill-defined heterogeneous hypoechoic lesions, some of which contain internal echoes. There is a heterogeneous rim surrounding some of the lesions. The visualized hepatic parenchyma demonstrates diffuse heterogeneity. These lesions were not suspected clinically and shifted the focus to differential diagnostic considerations of infectious and neoplastic processes; however, laboratory tests did not enable us to confirm a specific diagnosis. Torso CT was performed with intravenous administration of contrast material to establish the distribution of lesions and to identify the source. Figure 3 is a representative image of the chest obtained through the breasts that shows no breast or lung mass. Figure 4a is an axial dynamic contrast-enhanced CT image obtained in the arterial phase that depicts multiple complex low-attenuation lesions throughout the liver. A similar large complex low-attenuation lesion is seen in the spleen. There is slight heterogeneous enhancement of the splenic lesion but no enhancement of the liver lesions. Figure 4b shows the pancreas is fatty and atrophied, without focal mass. There is no renal mass. We identified soft-tissue masses in the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies on this image. In combination with chest CT images, the dynamic contrast-enhanced CT images helped us exclude the most common malignancies, including those in the breast, lung, pancreas, uterus, cervix, ovary, and kidney. Endoscopy and colonoscopy were also performed and revealed no mass, which enabled us to virtually exclude gastric and colon primary malignancies. Infectious and neoplastic processes were still the major differential considerations; thus, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) combined positron emission tomography (PET) and CT were ordered in an to attempt to distinguish between the two major differential diagnoses. Figure 5 is the FDG PET/CT image, which did not show abnormal FDG uptake in the lesions and added little information to the clinical picture. MR images of the abdomen were then obtained to better characterize the hepatic and splenic lesions. Figure 6 is an ultrafast spin-echo sequence that reveals a large heterogeneous T2 hyperintense lesion in the spleen and multiple heterogeneous T2 hyperintense lesions throughout the liver. Figure 7 was obtained with a dynamic postcontrast axial T1-weighted fat-suppressed gradient-echo sequence, and it depicts areas of heterogeneous enhancement of the large splenic lesion and peripheral enhancement of several of the hepatic lesions on the early arterial phase image (Fig 7a). Figure 7b was obtained in the late arterial phase and shows an additional peripherally enhancing lesion in the L1 vertebral body. The imaging and laboratory results failed to yield a specific diagnosis, so biopsy was requested. Angiosarcoma was not suspected by those who performed the procedure. Routine CT-guided biopsy of one of the liver lesions was attempted, but the results were nondiagnostic, as the lesions yielded only inflammatory cells and necrotic tissue. Substantial intraperitoneal bleeding was recognized several hours after biopsy and required multiple transfusions. The patient remained hemodynamically stable; however, at autopsy several days later, there was an estimated 3–4 L of blood in the abdomen. Figure 8 is an axial CT image of the head without intravenous contrast material obtained at the time of the patient’s spontaneous acute clinical decompensation several days after biopsy. It shows the extra-axial mass associated with acute extra-axial hemorrhage and associated mass effect, including subfalcine herniation. Figure 9 is the liver specimen at autopsy. It shows parenchymal involvement by ill-defined, hemorrhagic, and necrotic foci of angiosarcoma. Figure 10 is the spleen specimen at autopsy. It shows gross organ distortion and involvement by one dominant lesion and numerous cystic, necrotic, and hemorrhagic lesions that surround the larger lesion. Figure 11 is the histologic slice of the spleen. It shows an area of haphazard anastomosis of poorly formed vascular channels adjacent to an area of hemorrhage and necrosis. The vascular channels are lined by highly pleomorphic epithelioid cells of high nuclear grade. The autopsy findings of a large dominant splenic angiosarcoma and multiple smaller foci of angiosarcoma involving the liver and bones enabled us to confirm the diagnosis of splenic angiosarcoma.",Primary Splenic Angiosarcoma,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14110885/asset/images/large/radiol.14110885.fig1.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Axial T1-weighted (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 400/17; 5-mm section thickness) contrast-enhanced MR image of the brain (10 mL of gadopentetate dimeglumine administered intravenously over 15 seconds, Magnevist; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Leverkusen, Germany).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14110885/asset/images/large/radiol.14110885.fig2.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2: Transverse gray-scale US image of the upper abdomen.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14110885/asset/images/large/radiol.14110885.fig3.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3: Axial contrast-enhanced CT image of the chest acquired during the arterial phase (80 mL of iohexol 300 administered at a rate of 4 mL/sec, Omnipaque 300; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14110885/asset/images/large/radiol.14110885.fig4a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4a: (a, b) Axial contrast-enhanced CT images of the liver during the arterial phase (80 mL of iohexol 300 administered at a rate of 4 mL/sec).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14110885/asset/images/large/radiol.14110885.fig4b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4b: (a, b) Axial contrast-enhanced CT images of the liver during the arterial phase (80 mL of iohexol 300 administered at a rate of 4 mL/sec).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14110885/asset/images/large/radiol.14110885.fig5.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 5: Coronal T2-weighted (900/78, 6-mm section thickness) ultrafast spin-echo MR image of the abdomen (Symphony; Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14110885/asset/images/large/radiol.14110885.fig6a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 6a: Axial T1-weighted (4.3/2; 2-mm section thickness) dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrafast gradient-echo MR images of the abdomen (10 mL of gadopentetate dimeglumine) obtained during the (a) early and (b) late arterial phases.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14110885/asset/images/large/radiol.14110885.fig6b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 6b: Axial T1-weighted (4.3/2; 2-mm section thickness) dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrafast gradient-echo MR images of the abdomen (10 mL of gadopentetate dimeglumine) obtained during the (a) early and (b) late arterial phases.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14110885/asset/images/large/radiol.14110885.fig7.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 7: Unenhanced axial CT image of the head at the time of acute mental status changes and clinical deterioration.'}], [{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14110919/asset/images/large/radiol.14110919.fig1.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Axial T1-weighted (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 400/17; 5-mm section thickness) contrast-enhanced MR image of the brain (10 mL of gadopentetate dimeglumine administered intravenously over 15 seconds, Magnevist; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Leverkusen, Germany) shows a peripherally enhancing soft-tissue lesion extending through the diploic space into the parenchyma of the right frontal lobe.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.14110919/asset/images/large/radiol.14110919.fig2.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2: Transverse gray-scale US image of the upper abdomen shows ill-defined heterogeneous hypoechoic lesions.

While in flight, she experienced sudden onset of epigastric and midsternal chest pain with shortness of breath. Her symptoms improved markedly after she received oxygen on board, and she finished the flight without further incident. Once home later that night, the pain recurred, and she was taken to the hospital. Her history included chronic pain syndrome, hypertension, and refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, for which she had undergone radiofrequency ablation on two occasions. Her most recent ablation was 1 month prior.","An anterposterior radiograph of the chest at the time of initial presentation (Fig 1) showed a widened cardiac and mediastinal silhouette and a small bilateral pleural effusion. When compared with the baseline radiograph obtained immediately after radiofrequency ablation procedure performed 1 month earlier, no acute changes were noted. At re-presentation 2 days later, there was not only an acute increase in the size of the cardiac and mediastinal silhouette and pleural effusions (Fig 2a) but also an air-fluid level within the pericardium on the lateral image (Fig 2b). The presence of pericardial air connotes a likely communication between the pericardium and an air-filled structure, such as the esophagus or a bronchus; however, this finding was not noted at the time of the study and thereafter was ascribed to iatrogenic causes.",Pericardioesophageal Fistula after Cardiac Radiofrequency Ablation,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2015131417/asset/images/large/radiol.2015131417.fig1.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Baseline anteroposterior radiograph of the chest.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2015131417/asset/images/large/radiol.2015131417.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: (a) Anteroposterior and (b) lateral radiographs of the chest at the second presentation.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2015131417/asset/images/large/radiol.2015131417.fig2b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2b: (a) Anteroposterior and (b) lateral radiographs of the chest at the second presentation.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2015131417/asset/images/large/radiol.2015131417.fig3.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3: Water-soluble contrast material–enhanced (iodixanol, 320 mg of iodine per milliliter) esophagram.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2015131417/asset/images/large/radiol.2015131417.fig4a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4a: Unenhanced (a) axial and (b) obliquely reconstructed CT images through the level of the chest.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2015131417/asset/images/large/radiol.2015131417.fig4b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4b: Unenhanced (a) axial and (b) obliquely reconstructed CT images through the level of the chest.'}], [{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2015131662/asset/images/large/radiol.2015131662.fig1.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Baseline anterposterior radiograph of the chest reveals an enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette (straight arrows) with trace bilateral pleural effusion (curved arrows).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2015131662/asset/images/large/radiol.2015131662.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: (a) Anterposterior radiograph of the chest at the second presentation shows increased cardiomediastinal widening (straight arrows) since 2 days prior and mild worsening of pleural effusion (curved arrows).

Overnight, the patient became unresponsive and was found to be in a state of cardiogenic shock. A code was called, and he was stabilized after cardioversion and bedside intubation. His stay in the intensive care unit was complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient subsequently underwent multiple failed extubation attempts, requiring two additional reintubations. He was finally extubated 18 days after his initial admission to the intensive care unit. After he was discharged, he reported a hoarse voice and was only able to whisper. His voice varied in timbre and volume, and it became hoarser with use. Otolaryngology evaluation, including laryngoscopy and video stroboscopy, showed immobility of the right vocal cord. He was referred for speech therapy, and a computed tomographic (CT) examination of the neck was ordered (Figs 1–3).","Unenhanced CT of the neck revealed dislocation of the right arytenoid.

Ultrasonography (US) without Doppler performed at another hospital had revealed a pelvic mass; therefore, this patient had been referred to our institution for further evaluation. Unenhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was then performed at 8 weeks of gestation (Fig 1). The main portion of the gravid uterus and the ovaries were not seen on these images, but the parts that were seen appeared normal. Diagnostic laparoscopic biopsy was performed during the first trimester, but complete removal of the mass was deferred because of fears the pregnancy would be lost. The patient was closely observed throughout the pregnancy with serial US until the 37th week of gestation, at which time the patient underwent Caesarian section. At the time of Caesarian section, the mass was noted to extend from the spleen downward deep into the pelvis. A biopsy was performed at the time of Caesarian section. Definitive removal of the mass was deferred at the time of Caesarian section to minimize postpartum blood loss and to further delineate the mass with imaging for future surgery. Intravenous contrast material–enhanced (120 mL of Omnipaque 350; Nycomed Amersham, Princeton, NJ) computed tomography (CT) was performed 3 days after Caesarian section (Fig 2). The cystic component measured approximately 15 HU. Repeat MR imaging 1.5 months after Caesarian section was then performed (Fig 3). No loss of signal intensity in the mass was seen on fat-saturated images. There was no evidence of local or distant metastatic disease. The mass abutted and displaced the uterus and the ovaries but did not distort either of these organs. Vascular anatomy was not useful in determining the origin of the mass. The comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count were normal throughout and after the pregnancy.","T2-weighted MR images at 8 weeks gestation revealed a predominately T2 hyperintense mass adjacent to a gravid uterus (Fig 1). Note the strands of T2 hypointensity in this mass. The T1-weighted image showed a hypointense mass. The mass increased in size after delivery to occupy almost the entire pelvis and extended into the abdomen (Fig 2). The mass was of predominately low attenuation and appeared almost cystic, with streaky areas of higher attenuation. At 1.5 months after delivery, the mass decreased in the anteroposterior dimension by approximately one-half (Fig 3). Again, there was predominately T2 hyperintensity with streaky areas of T2 hypointensity.

Intravenous contrast material–enhanced (100 mL of Omnipaque 350; GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography was performed to evaluate for pulmonary embolism (Fig 1). On the basis of the CT pulmonary angiographic findings, chromogranin A and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels were measured and were 7 nmol/L (343 µg/L) (high) and 2.9 mg per 24 hours (15.167 µmol/d) (normal), respectively. This patient underwent bronchoscopy and biopsy. After these tests, she was referred for whole-body scintigraphy (Fig 2), which revealed an unexpected finding that was further investigated with fluorine 18 (18F) flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and CT (Fig 3).","The CT pulmonary angiographic images (Fig 1) showed a right bronchus intermedius endobronchial lesion. Note that the breast periphery was not included in the field of view because of the patient’s body habitus (body mass index, 42.3), effectively excluding the left breast lesion from the field of view. In Figure 2, A and B, the higher activity in the kidneys and spleen relative to that in the liver indicated that the planar whole-body scan was a somatostatin receptor scintigraphy scan (octreotide scan). These images showed a very faint focal area of increased activity in the left breast that was almost missed when the default viewing window settings were used (Fig 2, A) and was seen only after the intensity of the activity was increased (Fig 2, B). The corresponding SPECT and CT images (Fig 2, C–F) showed interval resection of the right bronchus intermedius carcinoid and development of right lower lobe consolidation with mild pleural effusion but no significant octreotide uptake to suggest residual disease. The SPECT image also enabled us to confirm intense focal activity in the retroareolar soft-tissue nodule in the left breast (Fig 2, E). A second nonavid nodule was seen in the left breast (Fig 2, C). The 18F FDG PET/CT images (Fig 3, A) showed an FDG-avid consolidation in the right lower lobe, with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 8.3, which was likely indicative of postbiopsy inflammatory changes. A 1-cm FDG-avid soft-tissue lesion in the left breast was also seen with an SUVmax of 3.9 and was likely neoplastic in nature. Figure 3, B, showed an enlarged FDG-avid left axillary lymph node measuring 1.5 cm in diameter with an SUVmax of 4.5; this lesion was likely metastatic. There was also a second 0.8-cm FDG-avid soft-tissue lesion in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast, with an SUVmax of 3.5; this lesion was likely multifocal breast cancer. Left breast mammography (Fig 4, A and B) revealed a 3.5-cm area of irregular focal asymmetry containing amorphous calcification at the left breast retroareolar region and corresponding to a region of octreotide and FDG uptake. In addition, a large region of architecture distortion was seen 14 cm deep to the nipple in the upper outer left breast, showing pleomorphic calcification. On the mediolateral oblique projection, these irregular calcifications are located in two separate locations. Ultrasoographic (US) images at the 2-o’clock position in the left breast 4–5 cm from the nipple showed a 1.7 × 0.9 × 0.9 cm irregular hypoechoic mass corresponding to the aforementioned octreotide and FDG-avid lesion. The remainder of the mammographic lesion also showed similar US findings. Together with the mammographic findings, these findings were consistent with a neoplastic process.

His temperature was 38.1°C, and physical examination revealed several small fluctuant masses that were draining purulent material. Skin culture of one of the draining lesions was performed at this time, but there was no subsequent bacterial growth. A diagnosis of furunculosis was made, and Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; AR Scientific, Philadelphia, Pa) and a regimen of chlorhexidine washes were prescribed. Two weeks later, the number of skin lesions had increased, and the patient had begun to experience night sweats and fevers. After an episode of hemoptysis and some unusual pain in the patient’s right testicle, he presented to the emergency department. At this time, chest radiographs were obtained (Fig 1). The patient was admitted for additional work-up, and computed tomographic (CT) images of the chest were obtained (Fig 2). Physical examination at the time of admission revealed scattered 1–3-cm firm pink hyperpigmented subcutaneous nodules, several of which had overlying pustules. This examination was also notable for a palpable fullness within the right testicle. The patient was afebrile at admission. He denied a history of contact with sick people, illicit drug use, or recent travel. His social history was notable for a 20-pack-year smoking history and a recent relocation to a neighborhood with several new construction sites. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 15.4 ×109/L; normal range, [3.5–10.5] ×109/L), a chemistry panel revealed a low sodium level (132 mEq/L [132 mmol/L]; normal range, 134–142 mEq/L [134–142 mmol/L]), and serum α-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin levels were normal. Ultrasonography (US) of the scrotum was performed (Fig 3). Serum analysis was negative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 RNA, and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory and rapid plasma regain tests were negative. Blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth. On the basis of chest CT findings, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (images not shown) of the abdomen also was performed to further evaluate a focal area of hypoenhancement within the pancreatic tail seen on chest CT images (Fig 4).","The initial posteroanterior chest radiograph (Fig 1) showed a mass in the right upper lobe, and contrast material–enhanced (125 mL of nonionic contrast material, iohexol 350, Omnipaque; GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) chest CT was subsequently performed. CT (Fig 2) showed paraseptal emphysema and a large spiculated mass in the paramediastinal right upper lobe, with several air bronchograms and a few small satellite nodules. Several lytic osseous lesions were present in multiple thoracic vertebral bodies (not shown). MR imaging of the abdomen was performed to further evaluate the pancreatic abnormality and showed decreased intrinsic T1 signal intensity in the tail of the pancreas, with corresponding restricted diffusion (images not shown). Scrotal US was performed because of the patient’s acute scrotal pain and imaging findings in the chest. Gray-scale and color Doppler US images showed a circumscribed intratesticular mass with associated hyperemia (Fig 3). At review of chest CT images showing the upper abdomen, an incidentally noted area of hypoenhancement was present within the tail of the pancreas (Fig 4).",Blastomycosis,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016142651/asset/images/large/radiol.2016142651.fig1.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Posteroanterior chest radiograph.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016142651/asset/images/large/radiol.2016142651.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: (a) Axial and (b) coronal reformatted arterial phase contrast material–enhanced (125 mL of nonionic contrast material, iohexol 350; Omnipaque, GE Healthcare, Princeton NJ) CT images of the chest.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016142651/asset/images/large/radiol.2016142651.fig2b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2b: (a) Axial and (b) coronal reformatted arterial phase contrast material–enhanced (125 mL of nonionic contrast material, iohexol 350; Omnipaque, GE Healthcare, Princeton NJ) CT images of the chest.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016142651/asset/images/large/radiol.2016142651.fig3a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3a: (a) Longitudinal gray-scale US image of the right testicle.

These lesions were discovered incidentally at multiphase contrast material–enhanced multidetector computed tomography (CT) performed in 2004 to investigate right lower quadrant pain. Imaging surveillance at sporadic intervals revealed slow progressive growth of the lesions over time; however, the number of lesions remained constant. There was no history of cancer, nor were there predisposing factors for chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. The patient had a history of menorrhagia, which was managed with oral contraceptive use for 20 years; this was stopped in 2013 after hysterectomy. The patient’s γ-glutamyl transferase (77 U/L [1.28 μkat/L]; normal level, <55 U/L [<0.92 μkat/L]) and C-reactive protein (97.1 mg/L [924.8 nmol/L]; normal level, <8 mg/L [<76.2 nmol/L]]) levels were chronically elevated at serum testing. In 2013, 9 years after the initial CT examination, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with gadoxetic acid (Primovist; Bayer Healthcare, Whippany, NJ) was performed. Finally, ultrasonography-guided biopsy of one of the lesions (in segment 5/6) was performed a year after MR imaging (Figs 1–3).","At MR imaging, at least 10 multifocal lesions were seen in both lobes of the liver. This included the index lesion, which was seen in segment 7 at the subcapsular border. The tumors ranged from smaller than 1 cm to 10 cm, while the index lesion measured 8.9 cm. The patient had a large body habitus, with a thick layer of subcutaneous fat. The background liver showed signal intensity loss on the opposed-phase T1-weighted image (Fig 1b) when compared with the in-phase T1-weighted image (Fig 1a), consistent with hepatic steatosis. In contrast, the lesions had higher signal intensity than the background steatotic liver on the opposed-phase T1-weighted image (Fig 1b) because of the absence of intralesional steatosis. On the T2-weighted image (Fig 2), the lesions had heterogeneous intermediate to high signal intensity, which was most conspicuous at the lesion periphery (termed atoll sign). On fat-suppressed gadoxetic acid–enhanced T1-weighted MR images, lesions showed heterogeneous hypervascularity in the arterial phase (Fig 3a), which persisted into the portal phase (Fig 3b). In the hepatospecific phase (Fig 3c) at 20 minutes, the lesions had low signal intensity compared with that of the surrounding liver parenchyma. The initial CT examination in 2004 showed the index lesion in segment 7 was a hypervascular 4.1-cm mass (Fig 4); this lesion had doubled in size at MR imaging in 2013.",Hepatic Adenomatosis Due to Inflammatory Adenomas,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016150247/asset/images/large/radiol.2016150247.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: Axial (a) in-phase (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 162/4.76) and (b) opposed-phase (162/2.03) T1-weighted 1.5-T MR images of the liver with 6-mm section thickness.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016150247/asset/images/large/radiol.2016150247.fig1b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: Axial (a) in-phase (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 162/4.76) and (b) opposed-phase (162/2.03) T1-weighted 1.5-T MR images of the liver with 6-mm section thickness.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016150247/asset/images/large/radiol.2016150247.fig2.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2: Axial T2-weighted 1.5-T (800/91) MR image of the liver with 6-mm section thickness.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016150247/asset/images/large/radiol.2016150247.fig3a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3a: Axial fat-suppressed T1-weighted 1.5-T (3.12/1.37) MR images of the liver with 4-mm section thickness (a) 30 seconds, (b) 60 seconds, and (c) 20 minutes after intravenous administration of gadoxetic acid (0.1 mL per kilogram of body weight).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016150247/asset/images/large/radiol.2016150247.fig3b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3b: Axial fat-suppressed T1-weighted 1.5-T (3.12/1.37) MR images of the liver with 4-mm section thickness (a) 30 seconds, (b) 60 seconds, and (c) 20 minutes after intravenous administration of gadoxetic acid (0.1 mL per kilogram of body weight).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016150247/asset/images/large/radiol.2016150247.fig3c.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3c: Axial fat-suppressed T1-weighted 1.5-T (3.12/1.37) MR images of the liver with 4-mm section thickness (a) 30 seconds, (b) 60 seconds, and (c) 20 minutes after intravenous administration of gadoxetic acid (0.1 mL per kilogram of body weight).'}], [{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016150420/asset/images/large/radiol.2016150420.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: Axial (a) in-phase (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 162/4.76) and (b) opposed-phase (162/2.03) T1-weighted 1.5-T MR images of the liver with 6-mm section thickness.

Symptoms began 4 year earlier, and the patient noticed a progressive decline in his daily routine due to gait difficulties in the past year. There was no history of head trauma, surgery, drug therapy, smoking, or alcohol abuse, nor was there any relevant family history. Examination revealed normal cognition (29 of 30 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination and 27 of 30 points on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and normal cerebellar, sensory, cranial nerve, and autonomic function. There was mild left-sided weakness involving the upper and lower limbs (medical research council graded muscle strength as 4+ out of 5) that was associated with facial hypomimia and a rigid akinetic syndrome only in the patient’s left hemibody (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] part III [motor examination], 23 out of 52 points). Mild atrophy in the left upper and lower limbs without pain, swelling, or skin lesions was noted at physical examination. Routine blood chemistry was normal, as were serum creatine kinase and aldolase levels and thyroid, hepatic, and renal function. T1- and T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion- and perfusion-weighted, and contrast material–enhanced brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging results were normal, without basal ganglia hyperintensity, lacunae, calcification, or heavy metal deposits. Muscle MR imaging (Figs 1–4) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium 99m (99mTc) tropane dopamine transporter (TRODAT) (Fig 5) were performed for further evaluation.

The left upper and lower limbs demonstrated mild atrophy when compared with the right upper and lower limbs. The left leg muscles demonstrated more fat deposition. SPECT with 99mTc TRODAT-1 imaging (Fig 5) showed decreased 99mTc TRODAT-1 binding in the right basal ganglia, indicating a contralateral parkinsonian syndrome. 99mTc TRODAT-1 is the first 99mTc-labeled tracer of dopamine transporters, which are proteins located in the membrane of the dopamine terminal in the striatum. The reduction of dopamine transporters correlates with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, as occurs in patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease and in those with Parkinson-plus syndromes (progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, and dementia with Lewy bodies) (1).",Hemiparkinsonism- Hemiatrophy—SPECT with 99mTc TRODAT-1 and Muscle MR Imaging Abnormalities,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016151718/asset/images/large/radiol.2016151718.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: Coronal T1-weighted MR images (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 500/18) of the (a) right and (b) left arms.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016151718/asset/images/large/radiol.2016151718.fig1b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: Coronal T1-weighted MR images (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 500/18) of the (a) right and (b) left arms.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016151718/asset/images/large/radiol.2016151718.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: Axial T1-weighted MR images (613/63) of the (a, b) right and (c, d) left arms.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016151718/asset/images/large/radiol.2016151718.fig2b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2b: Axial T1-weighted MR images (613/63) of the (a, b) right and (c, d) left arms.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016151718/asset/images/large/radiol.2016151718.fig2c.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2c: Axial T1-weighted MR images (613/63) of the (a, b) right and (c, d) left arms.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016151718/asset/images/large/radiol.2016151718.fig2d.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2d: Axial T1-weighted MR images (613/63) of the (a, b) right and (c, d) left arms.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016151718/asset/images/large/radiol.2016151718.fig3.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3: Coronal T1-weighted MR image (751/16) of the right and left legs.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016151718/asset/images/large/radiol.2016151718.fig4a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4a: (a, b) Axial T1-weighted MR images (692/16) of the right and left legs.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016151718/asset/images/large/radiol.2016151718.fig4b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4b: (a, b) Axial T1-weighted MR images (692/16) of the right and left legs.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2016151718/asset/images/large/radiol.2016151718.fig5.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 5: SPECT image acquired with 99 mTc TRODAT.'}], [{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2017151717/asset/images/large/radiol.2017151717.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: Coronal T1-weighted MR images (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 500/18) of the (a) right and (b) left arms show a little fat deposition (arrows) in the left deltoid and triceps brachii.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2017151717/asset/images/large/radiol.2017151717.fig1b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: Coronal T1-weighted MR images (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 500/18) of the (a) right and (b) left arms show a little fat deposition (arrows) in the left deltoid and triceps brachii.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2017151717/asset/images/large/radiol.2017151717.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: Axial T1-weighted MR images (613/63) of the (a, b) right and (c, d) left arms show the triceps brachii is smaller on the left side than on the right.

Laboratory work-up revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 58 mm/h (reference range, 3–23 mm/h), a hemoglobin level of 14.1 g/dL (reference range, 13.8–17.5 g/dL), a leukocyte count of 8.1 × 109/L (reference range, [3.4–9.7] × 109/L), a platelet count of 223 × 109/L (reference range, [158–424] × 109/L), an alkaline phosphatase level of 85 U/L (1.42 μkat/L) (normal level, <142 U/L [2.37 μkat/L]), a serum creatinine level of 93 μmol/L (reference range, 79–125 μmol/L), a serum total protein level of 82 g/L (reference range, 66–81 g/L), a serum albumin level of 39.3 g/L (reference range, 40.2–47.6 g/L), an albumin-to-globulin ratio (a test showing relative amounts of major plasma proteins) of 0.92 (reference range, 0.8–2.0), a urine protein level of 15 mg/dL (normal level, <20 mg/dL), a total serum calcium level of 2.46 mmol/L (reference range, 2.14–2.53 mmol/L), and a carcinoembryonic antigen value of 2.69 μg/L (normal value, <3.4 μg/L). Serology findings were negative for celiac disease. Thyroid function was normal, as were 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and chromogranin A levels. Initial radiologic examination included chest radiography and plain abdominal erect radiography (Fig 1). Gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to rule out inflammatory bowel disease or gastrointestinal neoplasm as a cause of chronic diarrhea. Endoscopic mucosal resection of two polyps from the cardia and duodenal bulb was performed during esophagogastroduodenoscopy, but histologic findings at hematoxylin-eosin staining were normal. Colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis involving the entire colon. Serum immunoelectrophoresis showed a monoclonal band, which was confirmed to be immunoglobulin Mλ at immunofixation. After histologic analysis of the bone marrow biopsy specimen, diagnosis of Waldenström macroglobulinemia was established, and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was requested to depict lymphadenopathy and organomegaly (Fig 2). On the basis of CT findings, two more specimens considered highly sensitive for the CT diagnosis were obtained via minimally invasive biopsy, but the results were negative. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (Fig 3) was performed a year later to control the progression of CT findings.","Initial chest and abdominal radiography revealed coarse and diffuse calcifications in the pericardial and abdominal regions, where their distribution mimicked renal contours (Fig 1). At CT of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, severely calcified deposits distributed diffusely within the mediastinal, subpleural, epicardial, intraperitoneal, and retroperitoneal fat tissue were evident, with sparing of subcutaneous fat tissue, lungs, intraabdominal solid organs, and muscles (Fig 2). Intraperitoneally, extensively calcified deposits were distributed within the greater omentum and mesenteric fat, and retroperitoneally, they encased the kidneys, ureters, pancreas, aorta, and inferior vena cava. At the initial examination, there was a small amount of intraperitoneal fluid; however, there was no clinically relevant lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, lymph node calcification, bowel dilatation, or wall thickening. Diagnosis of amyloidosis was suggested on the basis of the clinical and radiologic findings in this patient with Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Histologic analysis of biopsy specimens of the rectum and subcutaneous abdominal fat tissue was performed; however, amyloid deposition was not detected. Follow-up abdominal MR imaging revealed low-signal-intensity T2-weighted diffuse soft-tissue thickening of the same distribution within the intra- and retroperitoneal fat planes (Fig 3). The dominant symptoms became continuously more pronounced. Thus, 2 years after initial presentation, laparoscopic surgical biopsy of the omental fat was performed, and the presence of Congo-positive amyloid deposits was finally confirmed at histopathology (Fig 4). Specific therapy was introduced with a significant delay. Follow-up contrast-enhanced CT at the advanced stage of disease showed diffuse extensive thickening of the left ventricular wall attributed to cardiac amyloidosis. The patient had slightly decreased ejection fraction but pronounced restrictive diastolic filling at echocardiography, with bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and other signs of congestive cardiac failure.",Systemic Amyloidosis—A Complication of Waldenström Macroglobulinemia,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2017151157/asset/images/large/radiol.2017151157.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: (a) Lateral chest and (b) erect abdominal plain-film radiographs.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2017151157/asset/images/large/radiol.2017151157.fig1b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: (a) Lateral chest and (b) erect abdominal plain-film radiographs.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2017151157/asset/images/large/radiol.2017151157.fig2.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2: Contrast material–enhanced CT image of the pelvis.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2017151157/asset/images/large/radiol.2017151157.fig3a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3a: Unenhanced abdominal MR images, (a) Axial volumetric interpolated breath-hold image (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 4.89/2.38; flip angle, 10°, section thickness, 3 mm).

After a traumatic fall, he was hospitalized, and proptosis was identified at physical examination. Laboratory tests were remarkable for leukocytosis. Hematocrit level, thyroid stimulating hormone level, autoimmune antibody level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level were normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed bilateral intraconal masses, for which magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the orbits was subsequently performed (Fig 1). CT imaging of the chest and abdomen (Fig 2) revealed periaortic and retroperitoneal stranding. Perinephric biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease was made based on identification of a few plasma cells per high-power field that were positive for IgG4. Orbital biopsy was then performed, but the results were inconclusive for IgG4-related disease. The patient was discharged and given steroid therapy for presumed IgG4-related disease.","MR imaging of the orbits revealed T2 hypointense and enhancing intraconal masses that splayed the extraocular muscles and resulted in bilateral proptosis. CT imaging of the chest and abdomen revealed extensive enhancing soft-tissue encasement of the aorta and kidneys. Radiographs of the lower extremities showed patchy medullary sclerosis, with resultant loss of the corticomedullary differentiation.

The patient’s postnatal course was remarkable for resolving neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. A physical examination was remarkable for a palpable mass in the abdomen. Maternal risk factors included class II obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.","Prenatal US at 38 weeks (Fig 1a) showed a simple abdominopelvic cyst in the fetus and its relationship to the bladder.

At physical examination, the injured finger was swollen and purple (Fig 1). Passive and active flexion of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints were compromised, without interphalangeal instability. Radiography was performed in the emergency department (Fig 2), and the patient was released with a diagnosis of a fifth digit sprain. After the senior radiologist (V.M.C.) reviewed the radiographs, the patient was called back for assessment with ultrasonography (US) (Fig 3) on the same day. US was performed with an Aplio 500 unit (Toshiba Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) using a multifrequency linear array 7.2–18.0-MHz PLT-1204BX transducer focused at the level of the flexor tendon. The patient was sitting in front of the examiner, with the hand lying palm up on the examination bed. No abnormality was observed during color Doppler US.","The patient presented with a swollen injured finger with a volar reddish-purple color that was particularly pronounced distally. No wound or scar was observed on the skin (Fig 1). Anteroposterior radiography of the right fifth finger (Fig 2a) showed a subtle rectangular opacity projecting at the level of the PIP joint. Anteroposterior (Fig 2a) and oblique (Fig 2b) radiographs of the fifth finger show a radiolucent area with subtle cortical irregularities at the level of the distal phalanx.

There was no history of fever or penetrating injury in the left thigh. The patient had undergone renal transplantation 7 years earlier and had been taking immunosuppressants since transplantation. He had undergone two surgeries at the same site in the medial aspect of the left thigh in the past 3 years for a similar problem. At physical examination, there was swelling in the medial aspect of the left thigh with mild tenderness. A surgical scar was noted anterior to the swelling (Fig 1). No redness or discharging sinus was present. Laboratory results were as follows: hemoglobin level, 11.3 g/dL (normal range, 13.8–17.2 g/dL); white blood cell count, 9.7 × 109/L (normal range, [4–11] ×109/L); neutrophil, 75% (normal range, 48%–77%); lymphocyte, 22% (normal range, 10%–24%); eosinophil, 1% (normal range, 0.3%–7%); monocyte, 1% (normal range, 0.6%–10%); serum creatinine level, 1.3 mg/dL (114.9 μmol/L) (normal range, 0.5–1.6 mg/dL [44.2–141.4 μmol/L]); and serum glucose (random) level, 82 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) (normal range, 79–140 mg/dL [4.4–7.8 mmol/L]).

In addition, T2 hyperintensity in the bilateral thalami and basal ganglia without restricted diffusion or enhancement was evident and became more conspicuous at subsequent imaging as the patient’s symptoms progressed (Fig 2). High T2 signal intensity with ensuing swelling and peripheral enhancement of the bilateral inferior olivary nuclei compatible with hypertrophic olivary degeneration was also apparent at serial imaging (Fig 3).

During his most recent evaluation, he reported no specific symptoms and denied experiencing hematuria, dysuria, or abdominal pain. At routine surveillance magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis (images not shown), a lesion was noted in the peripheral zone of the prostate gland. The prostate-specific antigen level was elevated (7.51 ng/mL [normal range, 0.00–4.00 ng/mL]). The patient had no family history of prostate cancer and had never undergone prostate biopsy. MR imaging of the prostate with an endorectal coil was subsequently performed (Figs 1–3).","Axial and coronal T2-weighted images of the prostate show a distinct and smoothly marginated elongated lesion in the peripheral zone of the left base that is uniformly hypointense to the surrounding parenchyma (Fig 1a) and causes smooth but pronounced bulging of the overlying glandular margin (Fig 1b). Diffusion-weighted images obtained with a b value of 2000 sec/mm2 show no corresponding hyperintense signal in the left base (Fig 2a). On the apparent diffusion coefficient images, however, the lesion is predominantly hypointense and has an incomplete rim of even lower signal intensity (Fig 2b). On the dynamic contrast material–enhanced image, the lesion shows a subtle thin rim of enhancement early on (ie, prior to enhancement of the peripheral zone) that persists on the more delayed images, albeit without central enhancement (Fig 3a, 3b).",Granulomatous Prostatitis,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161176/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161176.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: T2-weighted (a) axial and (b) coronal MR images of the prostate.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161176/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161176.fig1b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: T2-weighted (a) axial and (b) coronal MR images of the prostate.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161176/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161176.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: Axial (a) diffusion-weighted (b value = 2000 sec/mm2) MR image and (b) apparent diffusion coefficient map of the prostate.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161176/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161176.fig2b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2b: Axial (a) diffusion-weighted (b value = 2000 sec/mm2) MR image and (b) apparent diffusion coefficient map of the prostate.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161176/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161176.fig3a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3a: Dynamic contrast material–enhanced MR images (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 4.6/2.3; 3-mm section thickness) after administration of gadobutrol (0.1 mmol per kilogram of body weight, Bayer Healthcare, Wayne, NJ) obtained (a) 10 and (b) 60 seconds after opacification of the femoral arteries.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161176/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161176.fig3b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3b: Dynamic contrast material–enhanced MR images (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 4.6/2.3; 3-mm section thickness) after administration of gadobutrol (0.1 mmol per kilogram of body weight, Bayer Healthcare, Wayne, NJ) obtained (a) 10 and (b) 60 seconds after opacification of the femoral arteries.'}], [{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161272/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161272.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: T2-weighted (a) axial (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 4169/110; 2.5-mm section thickness) and (b) coronal (2500/110, 2.5-mm section thickness) MR images of the prostate show a hypointense lesion in the lateral peripheral zone of the left base (arrow), which causes obvious bulging of the overlying capsular margin (arrowhead).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161272/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161272.fig1b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: T2-weighted (a) axial (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 4169/110; 2.5-mm section thickness) and (b) coronal (2500/110, 2.5-mm section thickness) MR images of the prostate show a hypointense lesion in the lateral peripheral zone of the left base (arrow), which causes obvious bulging of the overlying capsular margin (arrowhead).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161272/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161272.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: Axial (a) diffusion-weighted (2377/97; 3-mm section thickness; b value = 2000 sec/mm2) MR image and (b) apparent diffusion coefficient map of the prostate.

She did not have a history of fever, weight loss, headache, photophobia, seizure, or extremity weakness. Physical examination revealed left abduction limitation and right-sided hypoesthesia. Kernig and Brudzinski signs were absent, and pathergy test results were negative. Laboratory evaluation revealed normal complete and differential blood counts, normal serum chemistry, and normal immune function. Analysis of her serum was negative for antiaquaporin 4 antibody, rheumatism antibody profile, and paraneoplastic profile. Serum analysis was also negative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and 2 RNA, hepatitis B and C antigen or antibody profile, and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed clear fluid, a normal glucose level, an elevated protein level (45 mg/dL; normal range, 20–40 mg/dL), and an elevated white blood cell count (10/mm3 [0.01 ×109/L]; normal range, 0–8/mm3 [{0–0.008} ×109/L]; 81% lymphocytes, 19% monocytes). No CSF-specific oligoclonal bands were detected. Gram staining, acid-fast staining, and lactic acid and cryptococcal antigen test results were negative. CSF did not grow any bacteria, fungus, or acid-fast bacillus at culture. Spinal cord MRI, brain MR angiography, and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed normal findings (images not shown).

The cough started approximately 1 month prior to this appointment and was minimally productive of clear to yellow phlegm. In addition to her cough, she reported increased sinus congestion and a sensation of “something in her upper chest.” She denied shortness of breath, wheezing, hemoptysis, or cigarette smoking. Review of systems was negative for fever, chills, or night sweats.","Unenhanced chest CT revealed a round soft-tissue mass centered on the posterior aspect of the distal trachea, causing narrowing of the airway (Fig 1). At the level of the carina, a lobular soft-tissue mass was shown to obstruct the lumen of the proximal right mainstem bronchus (Fig 2). More inferiorly, an enlarged right mediastinal node caused a contour abnormality and approximately 50% narrowing of the right mainstem bronchus. CT revealed no parenchymal lung mass, no pulmonary consolidation, and no axillary adenopathy. Subsequent 18F FDG PET/CT showed FDG avidity of the tracheal and mediastinal masses (Fig 4). No additional abnormal FDG avidity was identified in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. The imaging findings of an endobronchial mass prompted bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy. At bronchoscopy, an exophytic necrotic mass with nodular mucosal invasion was seen in the distal trachea extending into the proximal bilateral mainstem bronchi.

She initially experienced occasional episodes of transient diplopia that developed while reading in the evening. She subsequently started to experience dry eyes and mouth, difficulty chewing, and mild dysphagia that worsened throughout the day. Her medical history included hypothyroidism from Hashimoto thyroiditis and pneumonia with left pleural effusion. She had no smoking history, and her body mass index was normal (23.8 kg/m2). No medication use was reported at admission. Physical examination revealed mild bilateral ptosis, reduced muscle tone and strength that worsened in proximal leg muscles, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. An edrophonium test revealed improvement in muscle strength and eyelid ptosis. Repetitive nerve stimulation revealed low amplitude of compound muscle action potential at rest (0.21 mV), with a marked increase (700%; normal increase, <60%) at high-rate stimulation (50 Hz). Laboratory work-up was unremarkable except for detection of acetylcholine receptor antibodies in the serum (21.30 nmol/L) and P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies (220 pmol/L). Recent MRI of the brain and spine at an outside hospital showed no abnormal findings. At admission, the patient underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig 1) followed by thoracic MRI (Figs 2, 3) to further evaluate CT findings.","CT (Fig 1a) showed a quadrilateral thymus with homogeneous solid appearance and lobe thickness within normal limits for patient age (1). CT revealed no mass lesions that were suspicious for malignancy. Thoracic MRI, which included chemical shift and diffusion-weighted imaging, was performed the day after CT. Chemical shift in-phase MRI (Fig 2a) revealed a solid low-signal intensity nodule in the right lobe of the thymus. The nodule was close to the right margin of the thymus, with no evidence of focal enlargement of the thymic contour. Opposed-phase MR images (Fig 2b) showed the quadrilateral-shaped tissue had decreased signal intensity, reflecting its fat-water admixture composition, with the exception of the nodule in the right lobe, which did not have decreased signal intensity. High-b-value diffusion-weighted MRI revealed a hyperintense spot in the left pleura (Fig 3), with restricted diffusion. Since pleural abnormalities were not recorded in the radiologic report from the previous CT examination, CT images were revised and showed a tiny amount of left pleural thickening (Fig 1b) corresponding to the site of pleural restriction at diffusion-weighted MRI. Radical transsternal thymectomy via en bloc resection of the thymus and adipose mediastinal tissue and resection of the pleural nodule revealed thymoma (World Health Organization [WHO] type B1) embedded in lymphoid thymic hyperplasia and a left pleural implant at histologic analysis (Fig 4).",Thymoma Embedded in Thymus with Pleural Implant in Myasthenia Gravis Lambert-Eaton Overlap Syndrome,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161760/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161760.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: Axial arterial phase contrast material–enhanced CT images of the thorax obtained with mediastinal window settings at the level of the (a) pulmonary trunk and (b) heart.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161760/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161760.fig1b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: Axial arterial phase contrast material–enhanced CT images of the thorax obtained with mediastinal window settings at the level of the (a) pulmonary trunk and (b) heart.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161760/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161760.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: Axial (a) in-phase (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 154/4.6) and (b) opposed-phase (154/2.3) chemical shift MR images of the thorax obtained with a dual-echo two-dimensional spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted pulse sequence in one breath hold.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161760/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161760.fig2b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2b: Axial (a) in-phase (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 154/4.6) and (b) opposed-phase (154/2.3) chemical shift MR images of the thorax obtained with a dual-echo two-dimensional spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted pulse sequence in one breath hold.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161760/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161760.fig3a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3a: Axial diffusion-weighted (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 4500/62) 1.5-T MR images of the thorax at the level of the heart obtained by using a single-shot spin-echo echo-planar sequence with b values of (a) 0, (b) 150, (c) 500, and (d) 800 sec/mm2 (5-mm section thickness for all).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161760/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161760.fig3b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3b: Axial diffusion-weighted (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 4500/62) 1.5-T MR images of the thorax at the level of the heart obtained by using a single-shot spin-echo echo-planar sequence with b values of (a) 0, (b) 150, (c) 500, and (d) 800 sec/mm2 (5-mm section thickness for all).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161760/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161760.fig3c.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3c: Axial diffusion-weighted (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 4500/62) 1.5-T MR images of the thorax at the level of the heart obtained by using a single-shot spin-echo echo-planar sequence with b values of (a) 0, (b) 150, (c) 500, and (d) 800 sec/mm2 (5-mm section thickness for all).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161760/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161760.fig3d.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3d: Axial diffusion-weighted (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 4500/62) 1.5-T MR images of the thorax at the level of the heart obtained by using a single-shot spin-echo echo-planar sequence with b values of (a) 0, (b) 150, (c) 500, and (d) 800 sec/mm2 (5-mm section thickness for all).'}], [{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018161761/asset/images/large/radiol.2018161761.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: Axial arterial phase contrast material–enhanced CT images of the thorax obtained with mediastinal window settings.

Physical examination revealed jaundice and mild right upper quadrant tenderness.

Serum amylase level was within normal limits at 84 U/L (1.40 µkat/L) (normal range, 38–149 U/L [0.63–2.48 µkat/L]). A clinical diagnosis of hepatobiliary sepsis due to ascending cholangitis was made.","The most recent contrast material–enhanced CT examination of the abdomen revealed a markedly distended periampullary duodenal diverticulum containing mixed-attenuation material (Fig 1). This obstructed the distal common bile duct and resulted in a moderate degree of proximal biliary ductal dilatation. The periampullary duodenal diverticulum also compressed the pancreatic head, but there was no associated pancreatic duct dilatation. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage were performed to relieve the biliary obstruction. Cholangiography showed a large filling defect within the dilated periampullary duodenal diverticulum, which was presumed to represent bezoar, enterolith, or a combination of the two (Fig 2). If unenhanced CT is not performed, differentiation between gas-fluid–attenuation bezoar and high-attenuation enterolith can be difficult. Follow-up liver function test results and measurement of C-reactive protein level were normal. The patient declined further invasive treatment and was discharged 2 weeks later with the biliary drainage catheter capped to enable internal drainage. At the time of this writing, routine percutaneous change of the biliary catheter was being performed at 3-month intervals, and the patient remained well. Follow-up cholangiography performed 4 years after initial percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography during a routine percutaneous biliary drainage catheter change showed the contrast-opacified periampullary duodenal diverticulum, which had markedly decreased in size and had no filling defect (Fig 3).",Lemmel Syndrome or Biliary Obstruction Due to a Periampullary Duodenal Diverticulum,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2018162374/asset/images/large/radiol.2018162374.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: (a) Arterial phase axial CT image at the level of the pancreatic head.

The child was born at term via uneventful delivery, and there was no history of familial hearing loss or maternal illness. Tympanic membranes were normal, and hearing loss was confirmed with auditory brainstem testing, which showed no response from either ear. Hearing aids were provided from 3 months of age, but no behavioral responses were noted when these were worn. He was also noted to have some mild developmental delay throughout his 1st year of life and was slow to crawl, roll over, and stand up. Physical examination showed no syndromic features or physical abnormalities. Ophthalmology confirmed normal vision and visual movements but bilateral anesthetic corneas. He had corneal abrasions due to minor repeated corneal trauma, and left-sided tarsorraphy was performed at 6 months. Facial nerve function, swallow, and voice quality were normal. To assess suitability for a cochlear implant, the patient underwent MRI of the temporal lobe and brain (Figs 1–4) and thin-section CT of the temporal bones (Figs 5, 6). The patient subsequently underwent left cochlear implantation.","Midline sagittal T1-weighted MRI (Fig 1) revealed abnormal and singular pontine morphology, with ventral flattening and a dorsal rounded cap protruding into the fourth ventricle.

Four weeks prior to the current admission he had been diagnosed with metastatic primary adenocarcinoma of the appendix. One week ago, he had been hospitalized with small-bowel obstruction, for which he required laparotomy and loop ileostomy. His medical history included basal cell carcinoma, rheumatoid arthritis, and Barrett esophagus. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen with tenderness at palpation within the right upper quadrant and lower abdomen and reduced bowel sounds at auscultation. Initial plain-film radiography of the abdomen at admission revealed dilated gas-filled small-bowel loops, suggestive of obstruction. His small-bowel obstruction was managed conservatively on this occasion. Nine days after his admission, the patient became unwell and reported a productive cough. He became tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypotensive.

The left adrenal gland retained its normal morphology but contained areas of relative low attenuation (average attenuation, 20 HU) within its superior and medial limbs (Fig 1a, 1b). The normal adrenal gland tissue could still be appreciated on the left side, as it was normally enhanced. Contrast-enhanced CT also showed subtle periadrenal fat stranding. These findings were new compared with the previous contrast-enhanced CT findings obtained 12 days earlier, which showed normal appearance and shape of the adrenal glands (Fig 2a, 2b).

A few days later, she underwent contrast-enhanced (100 mL iohexol, Omnipaque; GE Healthcare, Cork, Ireland) abdominal CT because of right upper quadrant pain.","An anterposterior pelvic radiograph (Fig 1) showed lytic and sclerotic areas with undefined margins on both sides of the left sacroiliac joint inferiorly and with adjacent sclerosis on the iliac side. Pelvic CT (Fig 2) revealed a lobulated hypodense lesion with internal septae in the sacrum, causing cortical thinning and destruction with extension into the neural foramina and soft tissue. There was also iliac bone extension through the widened sacroiliac joint. Erosion and sclerosis of the subchondral iliac bone were also seen. MRI (Fig 3) revealed a multilobulated cystic lesion with internal and rim enhancement and without any solid component. There was intra- and transarticular extension of the lesion, which also demonstrated rim enhancement. A left ovarian follicular cyst was also noted.

She had a history of hypertension controlled with hydrochlorothiazide, without any other cardiovascular risk factor and with neither personal nor family history of ischemic heart disease. She was postmenopausal and had a long-standing history of migraine headaches without hormonal or drug therapy. The patient had no history of clinically important thoracic trauma or invasive chest interventions. Initial electrocardiography (ECG) showed signs of ongoing anterior ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and emergent coronary angiography with angioplasty and intravascular US were performed (Fig 1). Maximal level of high-sensitive T troponins was 820 ng/L (normal, <13 ng/L), while echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, with no apparent regional wall motion abnormalities. General physical examination findings were unremarkable, excluding ligamentous hyperlaxity and joint instability. C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and angiotensin-converting enzyme blood test results were negative. For further evaluation, arterial phase ECG-synchronized CT angiography from the skull base to the pubis symphysis was performed (Fig 2).","Emergent coronary angiography showed 95% stenosis in the full length of the proximal segment of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, with significant flow limitations at both the distal LAD artery and the first diagonal branch (Fig 1a). Two guidewires were advanced beyond the lesion and were positioned distally in each branch (LAD artery and first diagonal branch). Afterward, a 4.0 × 23 mm everolimus-eluting stent was directly delivered in the proximal segment of the LAD artery. After coronary flow was restored, the electrocardiography (ECG) ST segment elevation and the chest pain disappeared. However, subsequent narrowing (80% stenosis) appeared at the proximal segment of the left circumflex (LCX) coronary artery (Fig 1b) after the interventional procedure. Initially, a conservative approach was intended, but the patient again developed signs of ischemia, including chest pain, ST segment elevation in the lateral leads of the ECG, and slower coronary flow in the LCX artery. Before a new attempt at angioplasty was made, an intravenous US examination throughout the left main trunk, LAD, and LCX arteries was performed. No atherosclerotic plaques were found. Normal lumen diameter was proved in the left main trunk, distal LAD, and distal LCX arteries (Fig 1c). Likewise, correct LAD stent result was proved. Finally, a suboccluded proximal LCX segment due to intramural hematoma compression was confirmed (Fig 1d). Immediately, a 4.0 × 33 mm everolimus-eluting stent was successfully implanted at the proximal LCX. Subsequent angiography revealed restoration of normal flow in the LCX and persistence of normal flow in the LAD arteries (Fig 1e).",Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection Associated with Fibromuscular Dysplasia,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2019170821/asset/images/large/radiol.2019170821.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: Coronary angiography of the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) arteries (30° right anterior oblique and 20° caudally angulated projection) and intravascular US of the LCX artery were performed.

She had baseline dementia and frailty and had been bedridden for 4 years. She did not have any recent falls or history of trauma at the site of swelling. She had a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that had been diagnosed and treated 7 years ago, and thoracoabdominal CT at last follow-up 3 years ago did not show any recurrence. Physical examination findings were unremarkable except for a painful hard and fixed mass measuring approximately 5 × 5 × 10 cm (in the transverse, anteroposterior, and craniocaudal directions, respectively) located at the right lateral superior thigh. The overlying skin was intact, without any color changes. Pertinent blood test results showed an increased white blood cell count of 13 000/μL (13 ×109/L) (normal range, 3700–11 000/μL [3.7–11 ×109/L]). The remaining hematologic and biochemical test results were normal. Abdominal and pelvic CT performed at presentation did not show any abnormal lymph nodes. Because chest radiography showed consolidation in addition to typical clinical picture, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and underwent antibiotic treatment for 3 weeks. US (Fig 1) and Doppler US (Fig 2) of the mass were performed. MRI was not performed because the patient had a pacemaker; instead, CT of the lower extremity was performed (Fig 3a, 3b).","US revealed a heterogeneous lesion primarily located at the subcutaneous tissue with ill-defined borders (Fig 1). The surrounding soft tissue demonstrated increased heterogeneous echogenicity, with thickened skin and subcutaneous tissues representing soft-tissue edema. Doppler US revealed increased vascularity within the periphery of a mass at the caudal portion of the lesion (Fig 2). Axial CT revealed a subcutaneous rounded lesion overlying the right greater trochanter; the lesion had the same attenuation as muscle and displayed indistinct borders (Fig 3a). Coronal CT images showed the lesion was continuous, with thickened fascia in addition to skin and subcutaneous tissue thickening; these changes were consistent with inflammation surrounding the lesion (Fig 3b). She underwent outpatient biopsy of the soft-tissue lesion due to lymphoma history and indistinct lesion borders. Biopsy showed a zonal appearance of necrosis adjacent to the reactive granulation tissue–like vascular proliferation (Fig 4a), with polygonal-shaped fibroblasts with abundant cytoplasm in the high-power view (Fig 4b), which were typical for decubital ischemic fasciitis. CT performed 3 months later with frequent repositioning and an air-fluidized bed showed that the lesion had substantially regressed (Fig 5).",Decubital Ischemic Fasciitis,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2019171254/asset/images/large/radiol.2019171254.fig1.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: US image of the mass at the level of the greater trochanter.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2019171254/asset/images/large/radiol.2019171254.fig2.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2: Doppler US image of the caudal portion of the mass.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2019171254/asset/images/large/radiol.2019171254.fig3a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3a: (a) Axial unenhanced CT image of the lesion at the level of the greater trochanter.

A clinical examination revealed he was tender to touch in the upper abdomen. Laboratory tests revealed a serum alkaline phosphatase level of 370 U/L (6.1 µkat/L) (normal range, 30–130 U/L [0.5–2.2 µkat/L]), a lipase level of 172 U/L (2.9 µkat/L) (normal range, 0–60 U/L [0–1.0 µkat/L]), a C-reactive protein level of 159 mg/L (1514 nmol/L) (normal value, <8.0 mg/L [76.2 nmol/L]), and a white cell count of 7 × 109/L (normal range, [4–11] × 109/L). During the present admission, the patient underwent urgent CT for his acute symptoms. His relevant medical history included a hospital admission 2 months earlier for abdominal discomfort. Given his history of chronic pancreatitis, baseline abdominal MRI was performed to determine the cause of his symptoms and to assess the pancreas (Figs 1–3).","An MRI examination performed during a prior hospital admission 2 months earlier due to abdominal discomfort showed distention of the intra- and extrahepatic portal veins and splenic vein with high-signal-intensity fluid (Figs 1a, 1b). On the corresponding gadolinium-enhanced (0.1 mL per kilogram of body weight; Magnevist, Bayer Healthcare, Whippany, NJ) T1-weighted images, these vessels showed a complete lack of enhancement (Figs 1c, 1d). Free intraperitoneal fluid was also noted. Additionally, a fistulous communication was visualized between the main pancreatic duct (MPD) and the main portal vein (MPV) at the level of the portal splenic confluence on the coronal T2-weighted image (Fig 2). The MPD and portal venous system showed matching high T2 signal intensities, as both these structures were filled with pancreatic secretions (Fig 2). A low T2 signal filling defect within the proximal MPD may represent debris or a calculus (Fig 2).

Although he was a native of Morocco, he had lived in Europe for many years and worked as a truck driver. The patient had a smoking history but had quit smoking 5 years prior to presentation. He denied alcohol abuse or recreational drug use. He did not have any allergies. Besides bilateral clubbing, the physical examination findings were normal.

The right side–to–left side heart ratio was estimated to be 1.58 (normal ratio < 1) and was associated with right ventricular hypertrophy (wall thickness, 9 mm; normal thickness, <4 mm) and an enlarged inferior vena cava. Few enlarged lymph nodes were seen. No pericardial or pleural effusions were observed (Fig 2). Pulmonary window settings showed diffuse well-defined centrilobular pure ground-glass opacities and an increased segmental artery–to-bronchus ratio (Fig 3). There was no hypolucency suggestive of pulmonary emphysema, nor was there evidence of bronchiectasis. The combination of pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure signs with centrilobular ground-glass opacities and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was highly suggestive of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH), which is now considered a spectrum of the same disease at different stages because of their shared features in clinical, radiologic, and genetic findings (1–4).",Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease and Pulmonary Capillary Hemangiomatosis Disease,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2019180472/asset/images/large/radiol.2019180472.fig1.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Anteroposterior chest radiograph.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2019180472/asset/images/large/radiol.2019180472.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: (a–c) Axial contrast material–enhanced (80 mL iobitridol 350; injection rate, 5 mL/sec) chest CT images obtained with mediastinal window settings at different levels of the thorax.

She had no antecedent infection or vaccination. She was admitted to the hospital and treated with methylprednisolone, furosemide, and C1 esterase inhibitor. On hospital day 2, she experienced a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure. At that time, she became hypoxic and was intubated for airway protection. Her laboratory study results preceding the seizure were remarkable for hyponatremia, with a blood sodium level of 122 mEq/L (122 mmol/L) (normal range, 135–145 mEq/L [134–145 mmol/L]), which was corrected to 137 mEq/L (137 mmol/L) over 48 hours. Same-day cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable, and unenhanced head CT findings (not shown) were normal, with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema.","Axial diffusion-weighted images (Fig 1a, 1d) showed symmetric areas of bilateral paramedian thalamic and pontine hyperintensity that had corresponding hypointensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (not shown); this was compatible with diffusion restriction and was thought to represent cytotoxic edema. Axial T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Fig 1b, 1e) showed more extensive confluent T2 hyperintensity with swelling involving the bilateral thalami, brainstem, and middle cerebellar peduncles, compatible with vasogenic edema. Within the areas of diffusion restriction, the susceptibility-weighted images (Fig 1c, 1f) showed punctate hypointensity within the areas of restricted diffusion in the bilateral thalami and pons, compatible with microhemorrhages. Meanwhile, MR angiography of the circle of Willis (Fig 2) showed no stenosis of the basilar artery. There were subtle short segment stenoses involving bilateral external carotid arteries, the right V4 segment, and the right P2 segment. This was confirmed with diagnostic catheter angiography (not shown). However, biopsy of an affected narrowed temporal artery revealed no evidence of vasculitis. At 1-month follow-up in the setting of improved symptoms and treatment of hypertension, axial diffusion-weighted images (Fig 3a, 3d) showed resolution of the prior diffusion restriction involving the paramedian thalami and pons. In addition, axial T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging (Fig 3b, 3e) showed resolution of the prior extensive confluent T2 hyperintensity and associated swelling involving the bilateral thalami, pons, and middle cerebellar peduncles.

He was admitted to evaluate progressive shortness of breath and dry cough of 1-month duration. He did not report fever, night sweats, or hemoptysis. Physical examination revealed he was afebrile and had normal pulse oxygen saturation. The examination revealed crepitation on palpation of the anterior neck, expiratory wheezes, and crackles heard at auscultation of bases of both lungs. Extensive maculopapular rash on the skin was consistent with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Laboratory tests revealed elevated liver transaminase and bilirubin levels that were attributed to liver GVHD. Nonenhanced thin-section CT of the chest was performed (Figs 1–5).","Nonenhanced CT showed extensive areas of air density in the mediastinum (Fig 1), spinal canal (Fig 2), and subcutaneous and soft tissues of the neck (Fig 3) and chest. There were linear air-filled spaces in the pulmonary interstitial tissue and along the bronchovascular bundles (Fig 1) that indicated pulmonary interstitial emphysema. Large airways were intact on the CT images (Fig 4). Nonenhanced CT of the chest showed a diffuse mosaic attenuation pattern in both lungs (Fig 1). Regions with lower attenuation contained smaller-caliber vessels, suggesting that the heterogeneous attenuation was due to varying geographic perfusion.

These were described as the patient “becoming pale with sinking to the floor and staring for approximately 1 minute with confusion thereafter.” The patient had years of reported seizure freedom until 2010 when she was evaluated for intractable headaches, and electroencephalography revealed her focal subclinical status. At that time, ambulatory electroencephalography findings showed asymmetric left parietal-occipital high-amplitude spike-and-wave discharges in her best awake and alert state. Since that time, the patient developed and continues to have complex partial seizures every 2–3 months that are persistent despite the implementation of several medical regimens.","Unenhanced CT revealed two hyperdense foci in the left temporal and occipital regions, consistent with coarse calcifications, with surrounding white matter hypodensity (Fig 1). Enlargement of the left temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes is shown on all images provided, most prominently the MRI scans. Importantly, the MRI scans also show frontal lobe sparing, without substantial enlargement of the left frontal lobe (Fig 2). Areas of predominantly hypointense T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal are seen in the left temporal and occipital lobes, without enhancement (Fig 3), corresponding to the previously described calcifications. Thinning of the cortex and thickening of the white matter within the affected regions is also seen (Fig 4). Polymicrogyria is seen in the affected posterior hemisphere. There is increased FLAIR and T2 signal at the medial aspect of the left temporal and occipital lobes, with extension to the left hippocampal and parahippocampal regions (Fig 4).

The patient’s history revealed that the swelling had been present since birth but had grown slowly. She had no history of relevant trauma. Her blood pressure was 145/95 mmHg (normal value, <115/76 mmHg), and her heart rate was 105 beats per minute (normal value, 75–118 beats per minute). The patient’s electrocardiogram displayed sinus tachycardia. Physical examination revealed soft-tissue hypertrophy in the left thigh and right lower chest wall. A painful soft and flexible mass measuring approximately 5 × 6 × 15 cm (in the anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal directions, respectively) was detected at the left thigh. Moreover, a painless soft mass measuring approximately 3 × 8 × 10 cm (in the anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal directions, respectively) was detected in the right lower chest wall, and the overlying skin was intact. Pink macules with a 3-cm diameter on the anterior left superior thigh and a 2.5-cm diameter in the left inguinal region were detected. Examination of other systems, including the cardiovascular system, revealed normal findings. Laboratory test results were within normal limits. Abdominal US showed perirenal vascular collaterals, and musculoskeletal US of the left thigh revealed vascular collaterals (images not shown). Therefore, thoracoabdominal CT angiography (Fig 1a–1c) and contrast material–enhanced MRI of the bilateral thigh (Fig 2a–2c) were performed.","Thoracoabdominal CT angiography with sagittal reconstruction showed a fatty right chest wall mass without any cystic or solid component representing fatty tissue overgrowth and extensive abdominal and left paravertebral varicose vascular structures (Fig 1a). Thoracoabdominal CT angiography with coronal reconstruction revealed hypoplasia in the left kidney, thoracoabdominal scoliosis, and fatty infiltration in the left psoas muscle (Fig 1b). Axial abdominal CT angiography (Fig 1c) showed fatty infiltration and reduction in muscle mass in the left psoas, quadratus lumborum, multifidus, and erector spinae muscles and extensive vascular malformations. Moreover, CT shows paravertebral vascular collaterals are associated with dural veins. Axial T1-weighted MRI of the bilateral thigh (Fig 2a) revealed fatty replacement of the left quadriceps femoris muscle, including vascular malformations, and disrupted the normal fibrillary pattern of striated muscle. Coronal T1-weighted unenhanced MRI of the bilateral thigh (Fig 2b) revealed fatty replacement and disrupted the normal fibrillary pattern of the left quadriceps femoris muscle and vascular collaterals extending to the left groin. Axial fatsaturated contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (Fig 2c) revealed enhancing low-flow vascular malformations in the left thigh. Time-resolved MR angiography was performed to screen for a high-flow component, and there was no high-flow vascular component in the left thigh. However, there was a high-flow vascular component in the pelvis (not shown). Excisional muscle biopsy was performed from the left thigh. In the cross-sectional macroscopic examination of the specimen, the dense fibrofatty tissue consisted of a variable mixture of vascular clusters and thin-walled blood-filled venous channels that separate skeletal muscle bundles. Abnormal lymphatic vascular components also were present. Genetic analysis of tissue biopsy revealed the PIK3CA gene mutation, and Sanger sequencing revealed the mutant allele frequency was 27.8%. The diagnosis of PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) was suggested according to clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings. Because of the congenital truncal lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, scoliosis (CLOVES), and left renal hypoplasia, a diagnosis of CLOVES syndrome was made. Moreover, the diagnosis of the fibroadipose vascular anomaly (FAVA) was made according to clinical, radiologic, and pathologic analysis findings comprising fibrofatty infiltration of muscle and atrophy of the affected muscles, unusual lymphatic and venous dilatations (phlebectasia) with pain, and lipomatous overgrowth of the affected extremity.",PIK3CA-related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS),"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2020192802/asset/images/large/radiol.2020192802.fig1a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1a: (a) Sagittal, (b) coronal, and (c) axial CT images of the thorax and abdomen obtained 30 seconds after administration of 40 mL of intravenous iohexol (Omnipaque; GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) (slice thickness, 2.5 mm).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2020192802/asset/images/large/radiol.2020192802.fig1b.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1b: (a) Sagittal, (b) coronal, and (c) axial CT images of the thorax and abdomen obtained 30 seconds after administration of 40 mL of intravenous iohexol (Omnipaque; GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) (slice thickness, 2.5 mm).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2020192802/asset/images/large/radiol.2020192802.fig1c.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1c: (a) Sagittal, (b) coronal, and (c) axial CT images of the thorax and abdomen obtained 30 seconds after administration of 40 mL of intravenous iohexol (Omnipaque; GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) (slice thickness, 2.5 mm).'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2020192802/asset/images/large/radiol.2020192802.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: (a) Axial (repetition time msec/echo time msec, 515/20; slice thickness, 6 mm) and (b) coronal (500/17; slice thickness, 6 mm) T1-weighted unenhanced MRI scans of the bilateral thigh.

One month earlier, he started to experience left chest pain with no cough. Pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) revealed a left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolus. The local hospital made a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). He received anticoagulants, and his chest pain was gradually relieved. At the time of current presentation, the patient was experiencing right lower extremity swelling and pain. Physical examination revealed a 4 × 3 cm palpable right inguinal mass with no redness. His medical history and family history were negative. The results of laboratory work-up were normal, with a D-dimer level of 0.16 mg/L fibrinogen equivalent units (reference range, <0.46 mg/L) and an international normalized ratio of 2.45 (therapeutic range, 2.0–3.0 for a patient taking warfarin), except the prothrombin time was 28.2 seconds (reference range, 9.6–12.8 seconds) and the activated partial thromboplastin time was 52.2 seconds (reference range, 24.8–33.8 seconds). Echocardiography, chest radiography, chest CT, and contrast-enhanced CT revealed no abnormalities. The patient underwent right lower extremity vascular conventional US (Philips IU22; Philips) with an L9–3 probe (3–9 MHz, venous condition) and contrast-enhanced US (1.5–2.0 mL, SonoVue; Bracco) with an intravenous bolus injection at the initial evaluation. Two days later, noncontrast and contrast-enhanced CT images of the lower abdomen (1.5 mL per kilogram of body weight, 300 mg/mL iomeprol, Iomeron; Bracco) were acquired for further evaluation (Figs 1–3).","The initial conventional US images revealed a 3.0 × 2.9 cm heterogeneous multilocular mass with well-circumscribed walls and hyperechoic internal septa arising from the right external iliac vein and the right common femoral vein (Fig 1a). Color Doppler flow imaging showed abundant blood flow signals in the mass, and spectral Doppler imaging depicted arterial blood flow signals with a 35.3 cm/sec peak systolic velocity and a resistance index of 0.81 in the mass (Fig 1b). CE US showed that the mass was enhanced inhomogeneously and simultaneously with the femoral artery at 18 seconds (Fig 2a[ID] FIG2[/ID]) and that the mass was multilocular with several unenhanced areas (Fig 2a, 2b). The CE US images indicated an intravascular tumor with neovascularization in the right external iliac vein and right common femoral vein. According to the contrasting features on CE US images, a tumor with neovascularization was more likely than a bland thrombus in the right external iliac vein and right common femoral vein.

However, this patient had an elevated serum globulin level of 47 g/L (normal range, 26–32 g/L) and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 36 mm/h (normal range, 0–20 mm/h), while C-reactive protein level was normal at less than 0.35 mg/dL. She was seropositive for antinuclear (titer >1/720), anti-Ro, anti-La, and anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies.","On the chest radiograph at the time of referral to our institution, there was an area of focal lucency in the mediobasal left lower lung (Fig 1). Lung volumes were preserved, and there were no reticular opacities to suggest substantial fibrotic or interstitial changes. Chest CT at the time showed multiple thin-walled cystic lesions of variable sizes surrounded by normal lung parenchyma with associated small subcentimeter intra- and pericystic nodules, distributed in bilateral middle to lower zones without involvement of the apices (Fig 2). Most of the lung nodules were not calcified. The basal lucency identified on plain radiographs likely corresponded to the largest (4.3-cm) thin-walled cyst in the mediobasal left lower lobe (Fig 2e).",Amyloid-associated Cystic Lung Disease and Coexistent Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2021200027/asset/images/large/radiol.2021200027.fig1.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Initial frontal chest radiograph obtained at presentation in 2006.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2021200027/asset/images/large/radiol.2021200027.fig2.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2: Initial noncontrast axial chest CT images obtained at presentation in 2006 by using lung and mediastinal window settings in the, A, B, apices and the, C, D, middle and, E, F, lower lung zones.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2021200027/asset/images/large/radiol.2021200027.fig3.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 3: Most recent frontal chest radiograph obtained 14 years after initial presentation.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2021200027/asset/images/large/radiol.2021200027.fig4.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 4: Most recent noncontrast axial chest CT images obtained 14 years after initial presentation by using lung and mediastinal window settings in the, A, B, apices and the, C, D, middle and, E, F, lower lung zones.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2021200027/asset/images/large/radiol.2021200027.fig5.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 5: Axial serial PET/CT images obtained at, A, B, 7- and, C, D, 13-year follow-up.'}], [{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2021200026/asset/images/large/radiol.2021200026.fig1.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Initial frontal chest radiograph obtained at presentation in 2006 shows tiny nodular densities in bilateral lower zones.

Her medical history was notable for Raynaud syndrome, recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, and an allergy to amoxicillin. Three days prior to developing diplopia, she presented to an outside emergency department due to fever, chills, and back pain. She received ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection based on urinalysis, which demonstrated few bacteria and was negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and white blood cells. She then presented again to an outside emergency department for diplopia evaluation. Initial MRI and MR angiography of the brain at that time did not demonstrate any relevant findings, and the patient was referred to our department for neuro-ophthalmic evaluation, where she was seen 4 weeks later. Neuro-ophthalmic examination revealed 20/20 visual acuity in both eyes, and a right hypertropia in left gaze, downgaze and right head tilt, with right eye excyclotorsion. There were no ocular signs of myasthenia gravis or thyroid eye disease, nor did the patient report ocular or systemic symptoms. She denied recent travel.

All other work-up, including complete blood count and chest radiography, yielded negative results. The initial diagnosis was lymphangioma of the thigh. He continued to experience worsening swelling in his right upper thigh with no other symptoms over the next year. He was referred to our facility, where he underwent US evaluation of the thigh lesion (Fig 1), an MRI scan encompassing the entire extent of his thigh lesion (Fig 2), and a CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis (Fig 3).","The US image showed a multiloculated hypoechoic lesion (Fig 1). The MRI scans showed a multiloculated lesion in intermuscular fascial planes of the thigh, with isointense signal intensity on T1-weighted images, hyperintense signal intensity on T2-weighted images and short inversion time inversion-recovery (STIR) images, and peripheral enhancement on the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (Fig 2). The coronal STIR images also showed that the lesion had thigh and intra-abdominal components (Fig 2). This finding of an intra-abdominal component prompted CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis. The axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis showed a solid appendiceal mass and a cystic retroperitoneal lesion in the right lower quadrant. The cystic lesion also had a few areas of calcification (Fig 3).",Pseudomyxoma from Mucinous Adenocarcinoma of the Appendix Extending from the Retroperitoneum into the Thigh,"[[{'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2021202311/asset/images/large/radiol.2021202311.fig1.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 1: Transverse gray-scale US image of the right upper thigh lesion.'}, {'img': 'https://pubs.rsna.org/cms/10.1148/radiol.2021202311/asset/images/large/radiol.2021202311.fig2a.jpeg', 'caption': 'Figure 2a: MRI scans of the right upper thigh lesion.

There were no other constitutional symptoms; in particular, there was no weight loss or loss of appetite. The serum amylase and serum lipase levels were always within normal limits, even during the current episode. There was no history of pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, drug use, or trauma. The patient was evaluated at an outside clinic 2 years ago and underwent imaging, including US and dedicated pancreatic CT, which revealed a complex multiseptated noncalcified pancreatic cystic lesion. After CT, the patient underwent endoscopic US, which showed the lesion was suspected to be an infected parasitic cyst; fine-needle aspiration and cytology were not attempted due to the risk of iatrogenic rupture. The patient was advised to undergo surgical resection but declined the procedure and was lost to follow-up for 2 years before her current visit to our facility. On clinical examination, there were no clinically important findings, aside from mild to moderate pain on deep palpation and some shifting dullness that was suggestive of ascites. The patient always remained hemodynamically stable. US-guided ascitic fluid analysis was performed, which revealed amylase levels of 869 IU/L (normal range, 4–234 IU/L). Considering prior CT and endoscopic US reports, the patient was further evaluated with a pancreatic MRI protocol for lesion characterization and to explain the new-onset abdominal pain (Figs 1, 2).","Axial T2-weighted images at the level of the pancreatic body revealed a thick-walled (>2 mm) multilocular hyperintense cystic lesion with free fluid in perihepatic and perisplenic locations (Fig 1A). Discontinuity of the wall of the cystic lesion was noted in the anteroinferior aspect, with rupture of the contents into the mesocolon (Fig 1B). Coronal T2-weighted imaging (Fig 1C) revealed similar findings, with rupture along the inferior aspect and spillage of contents in the mesocolon. A coronal T2-weighted thin-slab maximum intensity projection image (Fig 1D) revealed the rupture and showed the main pancreatic duct, with no obvious communication with the lesion. Unenhanced T1-weighted MRI scan (Fig 2A) showed hyperintense septae and wall (Fig 2B). Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted nonsubtracted image showed wall and septal enhancement within the lesion, which was substantiated on subtraction images (Fig 2C, 2D).

Her medical history was unremarkable, except for a previous visit due to facial photodermatitis 3 years earlier. Diazepam for a sleeping disorder was the only chronic medication recorded. Results of physical examination, blood count, and basic metabolic panels including assessment of renal and liver function were normal; only the ferritin level was slightly elevated (265 ng/mL [595 pmol/L]; normal range, 10–120 ng/mL [22–269 pmol/L]). Abdominal US was performed, followed by multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT and liver MRI due to the findings of the first study. A diagnosis was not established in that moment, and acetaminophen was prescribed for pain relief. As the symptoms continued, laboratory tests and imaging studies were repeated 2 years later, with similar findings and no notable changes (Figs 1–5).","Imaging examinations performed in 2017 and 2019 showed similar findings. Liver US revealed multiple solid and isoechoic nodules with a hyperechoic rim (Figs 1, 2). Some of them had a vessel-penetrating appearance, without mass effect (Fig 2). The lesions ranged in size from 1.6 to 2.9 cm. These nodules were not identified in two multiphasic contrast material–enhanced CT studies of the abdomen (Fig 3). Furthermore, there were no other abnormalities related to the liver structure, density, enhancement, or vascularity.

Brain MRI (Fig 3) showed a large area of nonenhancing T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR) hyperintensity with associated restricted diffusion corresponding to the large area of ill-defined hypoattenuation seen on the initial brain CT study. A dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion study (Fig 4) depicted markedly increased time to peak and markedly decreased cerebral blood flow. Susceptibility-weighted imaging revealed a prominent tortuous venous structure along the body of the right lateral ventricle and prominent medullary veins (Fig 3). A coronal image acquired with the T2 sampling perfection with application optimized contrast using different flip angle evolutions (SPACE; Siemens) sequence showed loss of flow void at the right internal cerebral vein (ICV), which was concerning for thrombosis. A CT venogram (Fig 5) obtained on the same day revealed no flow-associated contrast enhancement along the ICV consistent with the thrombosis, enabling us to confirm the imaging finding on the coronal T2 SPACE sequence image.

His medical history revealed that a cardiac mass was detected at echocardiography performed 3 years ago and for similar symptoms. However, he was lost to follow-up before his examinations were concluded. Apart from that, his medical history was unremarkable, and he had not experienced any cardiac symptoms in the intervening 3 years. He had a family history of sudden cardiac death, and his father died of a heart attack when he was 57 years old. Physical examination findings were unremarkable except for increased blood pressure (150/105 mmHg). Laboratory findings, including a complete blood count and creatinine, C-reactive protein, electrolyte, serum calcium, and troponin T levels, were within normal limits. Electrocardiography (ECG) was performed and revealed sinus rhythm and ST depression in the left precordial leads. Transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography revealed an irregular left ventricle mass. The patient subsequently underwent contrast-enhanced ECG-gated cardiac CT followed by cardiac MRI to evaluate the left ventricle mass (Figs 1–5).","Scanogram of the chest showed a calcified lesion superposed to the heart (Fig 1). ECG-gated cardiac four-chamber (Fig 2A), left ventricle outflow tract (Fig 2B), two-chamber (Fig 2C), and short-axis (Fig 2D) CT images revealed a calcified irregular mass with a tubular and infiltrative appearance in the basal inferior segment of the left ventricle, with extension into the mid-inferior wall, mid-inferior septum, and inferior papillary muscle. Three-dimensional volume-rendering reconstructions of a cardiac CT image showed the hyperattenuating irregular left ventricle mass with fluffy ossification (Fig 3). Axial unenhanced T1-weighted double inversion-recovery MRI without fat saturation revealed the irregular hypointense left ventricular mass compared with the myocardium (Fig 4A). Short-axis plane triple inversion-recovery MRI at the midbasal level of the left ventricle showed the hypointense irregular mass infiltrating the mid-inferior wall, mid-inferior septum, and inferior papillary muscle, with no myocardial edema (Fig 4B). Balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) MRI with three-chamber (Fig 4C) and two-chamber (Fig 4D) views of the left side of the heart and axial b-SSFP MRI (Fig 4E) showed the mass was hypointense compared with the myocardium. Midbasal short-axis plane cardiac MRI with cine early first-pass perfusion 30 seconds after contrast medium injection (gadoterate meglumine [0.2 mL per kilogram of body weight], Opaxol; Opakim) showed no contrast enhancement of the left ventricular mass (Fig 5A).
