Serological test for HIV was positive. Many acid-fast bacilli were found in his sputum. Chest radiograph shows an infiltration in the right upper lung zone with mediastinal widening. CT scans show diffusely enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes that have irregular low density internally and rim enhancement. An irregularly shaped gas collection is seen in the right subcarinal area, which communicates with esophageal gas. An esophagogram with gastrografin (not shown) showed a fistulous communication between the esophagus and the gas-filled space. After two months of anti-tuberculous medication, the right upper lung zone infiltration and mediastinal bulging showed marked improvement. Esophagogram was normal. The patient died of mixed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and cytomegalovirus infection 3 months later.","Esophageal involvement by tuberculosis usually occurs in the late stages of tuberculosis secondary to pulmonary, mediastinal, or disseminated disease. Direct contiguous involvement from adjacent tuberculous lymphadenitis is known to be the most frequent cause of esophageal tuberculosis. On contrast enhanced CT, these lymph nodes typically show central low density with peripheral rim enhancement representing caseation necrosis and hyperemic granulation tissue, respectively. Necrotic material within the tuberculous mediastinal lymph node can be extruded through an esophageal and/or tracheobroncheal fistula, resulting in a localized gaseous collection within the mediastinum. Even though tuberculous lymphadenitis involves right paratracheal nodes more commonly than subcarinal nodes, as the diseased right paratracheal nodes have less chance to contact the esophagus than the subcarinal nodes, fistulous communication is more prone to occur in the subcarinal area. In contrast to the poor prognosis associated with esophageal rupture by forceful vomiting or by other trauma, esophageal perforation by tuberculous esophagomediastinal fistulas tends to close uneventfully during anti-tuberculous therapy.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-324-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-324-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-324-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-324-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-324-5.jpg']",0,[]

However, the disease process is not confined to only one lung. It may occur in various anatomic distributions, including various lobar distributions. Most cases of this disease are caused by bronchial and bronchiolar infection, probably viral origin during childhood. 
The main radiological findings are a remarkable difference in the radiolucency of the two lungs by decreased perfusion, attenuation of the pulmonary vessels, diminutive but present ipsilateral hilum, normal or reduced volume of the affected lung (The younger the patient at the time of the viral infection, the smaller the fully developed lung.), air trapping during expiration, and irregular dilatation of the segmental bronchi with abrupt ending in squared or tapered termination.

Differential diagnoses include lymphoma, thymic neoplasms, substernal thyroid mass, germ cell tumors, and in Korea, mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenopathy should be included.  Hopper et al. reported that necrotic, cystic-appearing mediastinal lymph nodes are a common finding in newly diagnosed Hodgkin disease, occuring in 21% of cases. Necrosis is common in the more sclerotic forms of Hodgkin disease. These necrotic areas range from minute foci of fibrinoid necrosis to large areas of granular tissue destruction containing necrotic cells. Necrosis is seen most commonly in the nodular sclerosing and mixed celluarity cell types of lymphoma and is not seen in the lymphocyte predominant variety. Nodal necrosis is most extensive in the nodular sclerosing variety. This cystic appearance of mediastinal adenopathy in the patients with Hodgkin disease does not affect overall survival or length of remission.  Hodgkin disease involve anterior mediastinum or paratracheal regions in 90%-100% of  cases, but confined to the anterior mediastinum in approximately 40% of cases. Superior mediastinum is almost invariably involved. Hodgkin disease spreads from the anterior mediastinal/paratracheal area in a contiguous manner.

Solitary nodules are located in the periphery of the lungs and show spiculated borders (star pattern, due to infiltrative tumor growth, localized lymphangitic spread, or desmoplastic reaction), pleural tags, bubblelike lucencies or pseudocavitation. Segmental or lobar consolidation can be caused by the combination of tumor growth along the alveolar wall and secretion of mucin. Production of mucin can cause swelling of the lobe, leading to bulging of interlobar fissure, and heterogenous attenuation in small masses or uniform low attenuation with CT angiogram sign in more confluent consolidation.

More recently, the definition has been expanded to include those cases in which peribronchial calcific nodal disease distorts the tracheobronchial tree without erosion of the calcific lymph node into the bronchus. Most broncholiths arise from peribronchial lymph nodes that calcify after an inflammatory process. They may erode into an adjacent bronchus, and the associated inflammatory process may distort the bronchus. 
The CT findings are: 1) a calcified lymph node that is either endobronchial or peribronchial, 2) the presence of changes due to bronchial obstruction; atelectasis, infiltrates, bronchiectasis, or air trapping, and 3) the absence of an associated soft-tissue mass. 
Bronchoscopy is a relatively insensitive technique for the detection of broncholiths. The failure of bronchoscopy to identify some broncholiths is due to the node being peribronchial or to bronchial distortion obscuring an endobronchial node. An important role of bronchoscopy is to exclude an endobronchial neoplasm, which in rare cases may be calcified and simulate a broncholith.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-427-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-427-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-427-3.jpg']",0,[]

Pathologically DPB is characterized by thickening of the walls of terminal and respiratory bronchioles by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes. Intramural fibrosis may be present and, in combination with the mural infiltrate, results in significant airway narrowing. Apart from hyperinflation and the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages distal alveolar ducts and lung parenchyma are usually normal. 

The changes are more or less diffuse throughout the lungs resulting in roentgenographic evidence of a disseminated nodular pattern with lower zonal predominance. Evidence of hyperinflation is also present. HRCT can show four types of opacities: 1) small nodules around the end of bronchovascular branchings, 2) small nodules in the centrilobular area connected with small branching linear opacities, 3) nodules accompanied by small ductal opacities connected to proximal bronchovascular bundles, and 4) large cystic opacities accompanied by dilated proximal bronchi. 

Most patients are between 30 and 60 years of age; the male ro female ratio is approximately 2 to 1. The chief clinical manifestations are dyspnea on exertion and cough, often with sputum production. Sinusitis is common. In the late stages, sputum culture often reveals the presence of microorganisms, especially P. aeruginosa, suggesting the development of airway colonzation.

The most important cause of disease in humans is A. israelii. This organism is characterized by its mycelial granules, which are usually called sulfur granules because of their yellow color. The organisms are normal inhabitants of the human oropharynx, especially in persons with poor oral hygine. In the majority of cases, disease is aquired by the direct spread of endogenous organisms from the oropharynx into the lung or into the gastrointestinal tract. Most infections occur in individuals who are not immunocompromised. Grossly, chronic pulmonary actinomycosis is characterized by multiple abscesses interconnected by granulating sinus tracts and surrounded by a variable amount of fibrous tissue. Histologically, the abscesses are composed of an outer rim of grannulation tissue surrounding masses of polymorphonuclear leukocytes that often contain typical sulfur granules. Surrounding lung parenchyma shows a variable degree of fibrosis and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. 
The typical pattern in the acute variety of actinomycosis consists of airspace pneumonia, without recognizable segmental distribution, commonly in the periphery of the lung and with a predilection for the lower lobes. With appropriate therapy, most cases resolve without complications. Actinomycosis frequently presents roentgenographically as a mass that simulates pulmonary carcinoma. According to the many articles and textbook, extension across the pleural fissures and into the chest wall is common. But recent study for the radiologic findings of thoracic actinomycosis in SNUH (in press) revealed that all 22 patients showed no evidence of chest wall involvement. Chronic segmental air-space consolidation containing round to oval, peripherally enhancing low attenuation areas, adjacent pleural thickening were characteristic CT findings of thoracic actinomycosis.

Intralobar sequestration is more common than extralobar type in which the seqestered pulmonary parenchyma is enclosed within its own pleural membrane. 
Intralobar sequestration: The abnormal tissue derives its arterial supply from the aorta or one of its branches and venous drainage is via the pulmonary venous system, producting a left-to-right shunt. In approximately two-thirds of cases, the sequestered portion of lung is situated in the paravertebral gutter within the posterior bronchopulmonary segment of the left lower lobe; in most others it occupies the same anatomic region of the right lower lobe. The upper lobes are rarely affected. Bilateral sequestration is also very rare. The radiographic appearance is dependent largely upon the volume of lung tissue sequestered, the presence or absence of infection, and the space-occupying nature of the process.  Without infection or air-way communication with normal lung, the anormalous tissue appears as a homogenous, sharply-defined, lobulated mass of unit density in the posterior portion of a lower lobe.

    Leptospirosis, caused by the spirochete Leptospira, is an acute, febrile, systemic diseass comprising fever, jaundice, hemorrhage, nephritis, and meningitis. Leptospirosis follows contact with contaminated water or tissues of infected animals. Leptospirosis is common in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in the far East. 
    Pneumonia occurs in one fifth to two thirds of patients with leptospirosis. Im et al reviewd the chest radiographic findings in 37 patients of 58 serologically proven leptospirosis, who had the positive radiographic findings, with pathologic correlation by experimental study (AJR 1989; 152: 955-959). Three radiographic patterns were evident: (1) 21 (57%) of the 37 patients had small nodular desnsities, (2) six (16%) had large confluent areas of consolidation, and (3) 10 (27%) had diffuse, ill-defined, ground-glass density. Serial radiographs showed a tendency for the nodular pattern to be followed by confluent consolidation and/or ground-glass opacity, as this case. Abnormalites were bilateral, nonlobar in all cases, and had a marked tendency toward peripheral predominance.

In the lung, the term traditionally refers to a well-circumscribed tumor consisting predominantly of cartilarge and adipose tissue. In recent years, several authors have proposed that they are best regarded as benign neoplasms, probably derived from an undifferentiated bronchial wall mesenchymal cell. 
    Hamartomas are uncommon pulmonary neoplasms (5.7% of 2958 solitary lung lesions). Most are discovered in adulthood, with a peak incidence in the sixth decade. The tumors occur most often in males (2~3 times). Approximately 90% of pulmonary hamartomas are located within the parenchyma, usually in a peripheral location. Endobronchial hamartoma is a special form of the usual intrapulmonary hamartoma, which originates from a large bronchus, grows into the lumen, and obstructs the bronchi before it grows big. Most endobronchial tumors, therefore, produce symptoms, such as cough and fever, due to bronchial obstruction. 
    Endobronchial hamartomas most often appear as fleshy, polypoid tumors attached to the bronchial wall by a narrow stalk. The central portion is usually composed of a core of adipose tissue surrounded by somewhat compressed loose fibrous tissue. Smooth muscle, seromucinous glands, and myxomatous tissue may be admixed. Cartilage is often absent or present in small amounts. In a small percentage of cases, bronchial obstruction leads to atelectasis, obstructive pneumonitis, and progressive peripheral lung destruction. Whenever a fatty endobronchial mass is identified on CT scans, the differential diagnosis should be narrowed to lipoma and hamartoma.",,"['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-66-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-66-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-66-3.jpg']",0,"['correct:6/0', 'semi:2/0']"

HX exhibited cysts scattered throughout the lung parenchyma. In almost all patients, HRCT demonstrates cystic air-spaces, which are usually less than 10 mm in diameter; these cysts are characteristic of HX. On HRCT, the lung cysts have walls that range from being barely perceptible to being several millimeters in thickness. The presence of distinct walls allows diffrentiation of these cysts from areas of emphysema. Although many cysts appear round, they can also have bizarre shapes, being bilobed, clover-leaf shaped, or branching in appearance. Confluent or conjoined cysts with persisting septations are seen in more than two thirds of patients. HRCT findings closely mirror the gross pathologic appearances of this disease. The cysts were lined with fibrous tissue which interrupted focally by a diverse population of inflammatory cells and histiocytes. Interstitial cellular infiltration is associated with destruction and retraction of the lung parenchyma, alterations which appeared to result in the formation of new cystic spaces. The Langerhans' histiocyte may play a role in the production of fibrous tissue in the early formation of cyst walls. The mechanism of cystic changes is uncertain. Patterns of the nodules or cysts may represent longevity of the lesions. Early stage of the disease is characterized by the abundance of nodules and cavitated nodules, whereas cysts are few and do not tend to be conluent. Advanced disease is characterized by a small number of nodules, whereas cysts have increased in number and size and are confluent.

On microscopic findings, pulmonary parenchymal hamartoma composed predominantly of irregular and broad cartilage masses. The cartilage is surrounded by a rim of fat or fibromyxoid connective tissue. The peripheries are lined by respiratory epithelium. 
    Hamartomas are the most common benign lung neoplasms and pathologically composed of cartilage with clefts lined by bronchial epithelium and fat, or cystic collections of fluid. Some authors prefer the term “hamartochondroma” or “chondromatous hamartoma” to distinguish these lesions from the much rarer vascular hamartomas that do not contain cartilage. 
    Most tumors present as a solitary asymptomatic parenchymal lung nodule that may gradually increase in size. Pulmonary hamartomas typically are well-circumscribed solitary nodules, the majority smaller than 4 cm in diameter, without lobar predilection. Approximately one-third have a smooth outline, which may aid in differentiation from the almost invariably lobulated pulmonary carcinoma. Over 90% are situated peripherally, with 8 % or less arising in central bronchi. The peripheral lesions are asymptomatic; the endobronchial hamartomas may cause of bronchial obstruction and hemoptysis. The average age at presentation of pulmonary hamartoma is 45 to 50 years.

Percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy yields diagnostic information in as many as 85 percent of patients.

The pulmonary hamartoma can be specifically recognized when focal deposits of fat are identified by a CT number in the -80 to -120 HU range. Hamartomas represent a very small proportion of all pulmonary nodules, but because they are frequently not recognized preoperatively, they account for 6-8% of all resected pulmonary nodules. Cartilage is generally the dominant mesenchymal component of the lesion, often leading to calcification. The larger the lesion, the more likely that it will calcify. Definite calcification is seen on plain film in up to 15%. Some researchers reported in 20 resected solitary hamartomas of the lung. Analyzing the lesions histologically, they found fatty tissue in 7 cases and chondroid tissue in 13 of 20.

In type 2, multiple small cysts less than 2 cm in diameter are characteristic. Type 3 consists of solid adenomatoid tissue. 
  This condition occurs with equal frequency in boys and girls; 14% of cases occur in stillborn infants, and 63% have symptoms in the first month of life. 
Radiographic study shows marked expansion of what appears to be an entire lung with consequent shift of the mediastinum and compression of the contralateral lung. The involved lung is composed of opaque tissue interspersed with cysts, air-containing spaces of varying size that may contain fluid levels. Occasionally a single cyst predominates. The lesion may initially appear solid if the radiograph is obtained before the fatal lung fluid has drained; it appears cystic only where air replaces the fluid. 
In type I, several large cysts fill the hemithorax and displace the heart and mediastinum. In one large cyst dominates the pathology of the process, distinction from congenital lobar emphysema may be difficult. Exceptionally, the cysts may be entirely filled with fluid simulating a type III lesion or another condition entirely.

Proliferation of spindle cells along the bronchioles leads to air-trapping and development of emphysema and thin-walled lung cysts. Rupture of these cysts can result in pneumothorax. Involvement of lymphatic system leads to lymphadenopathy, distention of thoracic duct, and chylous pleural effusion or ascites. Proliferation of spindle cells along the venous wall causes venous obstruction, leading to pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and hemosiderosis. 
    LAM occurs only in the women of childbearing age, usually between 17 and 50 years. Identical clinical, radiological, and pathologic pulmonary changes may be seen in about 1% of the patients with tuberous sclerosis. Although tuberous sclerosis affects both sex equally, the pulmonary changes have been described almost exclusively in women. 
    The plain radiographic findings of LAM include reticular, reticulonodular, miliary, honeycomb patterns, and hyperinflation, may precede, accompany, or postdate other manifestation od the disease such as pneumothorax, and chylous pleural effusion. On HRCT, patients with LAM characteristically show numerous thin-walled lung cysts, surrounded by relatively normal lung parenchyma.

Enhanced CT scans show several patchy opacities with air-bronchogram and homogeneous enhancement in the both lungs. There are several lymph nodes in the para-tracheal area and the anterior mediastinum, which are homogeneously enhanced. On lung-setting CT scan, the outer borders of the opacities are shaggy.","Lymphomatous involvement of the lung can be classified into the four categories: primary lymphoma of the lung, recurrent or secondary lymphoma, lymphoma in the patients with posttansplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), and AIDS-related lymphoma (ALD). Primary pulmonary lymphoma is usually non-Hodgkin’s in type (low-grade B-cell type is common). The frequency of lymphoma arising in the lung is estimated to be less than 1% of all lymphomas. Although thoracic Hodgkin’s disease typically presents with lymphadenopathy, a rare form of pulmonary Hodgkin’s disease is restricted to the pulmonary parenchyma at presentation. Primary pulmonary lymphoma is diagnosed with the following strict criteria: the lung or bronchus or both are involved, without evidence of mediastinal adenopathy or a mass on chest radiographs; extrathoracic lymphoma was not diagnosed previously; no evidence of extrathoracic lymphoma or lymphatic leukemia at the time that primary lymphoma of the lung was diagnosed, as evaluated on the basis of the results of physical examination, complete blood counts, abdominal sonography or CT scan or lymphography, and bone marrow aspiration or biopsy or both; and the disease was not present outside the thorax for at least 3 months after diagnosis. 
    Most common radiologic appearance of primary non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the lung is an area of opacification with poorly defined margins and an air-bronchogram. Less common radiographic patterns of primary lymphoma of the lung include nodules, diffuse bilateral air space consolidation, and segmental or lobar atelectasis. Non-Hodgkin’s involvement of the lung can take the form of so-called mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) or the closely related bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). In MALT and BALT, lymphomatous masses develop in multiple extranodal mucosal sites throughout the lung, giving rise to multiple pulmonary masses in imaging studies. Pleural involvement is rare. Primary Hodgkin’s disease most commonly presents as single or multiple nodules with an upper lobe predominance. The nodules frequently cavitate. 
    The incidence of secondary involvement of the lung at initial presentation is 12 % of patients with Hodgkin’s disease and 4% of patient with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In Hodgkin’s disease, pulmonary involvement is almost always associated with radiographically evident hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma may involve the mediastinal nodes and lungs or may be limited to the lungs. On chest radiographs, secondary pulmonary lymphoma may present with various pattern: thickening of bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septae (41%), discrete pulmonary nodules (39%), areas of consolidation (14%), and disseminated micronodules (6%). Lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion are also commonly present. Other manifestations include cavitated masses and endobronchial masses. Most common CT features of secondary pulmonary lymphoma are masses or masslike areas of consolidation larger than 1cm and nodules smaller than 1cm.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-70-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-70-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-70-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-70-4.jpg']",41,"['correct:19/41', 'semi:14/41']"

The shape of the mass was altered examination to examination. On right lateral decubitus image, the mass moved laterally. CT scans demonstrated a soft tissue density mass with moderate heterogenous enhancement and feeding vessels after intravenous contrast material injection. The right lower lobe was compressed by the tumor. On T1-weighted MR images, the mass had an intermediate and low heterogeneous signal. On T2-weighted images, the mass had low central signal and high peripheral signal intensity. At thoracotomy, encapsulated mass of the pleura weighing 1200g was removed. The tumor was attached to the visceral pleura of the left lower lobe by a single stalk. Hypogycemia was corrected after surgery. Sections through the mass showed a white-gray fibrous appearance and necrosis. Histologically, the lesion was localized malignant fibrous tumor of the pleura. ","The term ""localized benign (or malignant) fibrous tumor of the pleura (LFTP)"" is preferred because histologically these tumors do not contain epithelial cells but derive from a submesothelial mesenchymal cell with fibroblastic differentiation. LFTP accounts for fewer than 5% of pleural tumors and these tumors are unrelated to asbestos exposure. Approximately 70 to 80% of these tumors arise from visceral pleura, with the remainder arising from the parietal pleura. A small number are intrapulmonary in location. Most are pedunclated. Large areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are more suggestive of malignant behavior. In Briselli and colleague's review, the best predictor of a good prognosis was the presence of pedicle. Clinically, LFTP occurs in both sexes and in all age groups but predominantly affects persons more than 50 years. Approximately 50% of patients are asymmtomatic, and 40% of symptomatic patients complain chest pain, cough and dyspnea. Extrathoracic manifestations include hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in 4 - 35% and hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia, noted in less than 5% of patients, is usually associated with very large tumor and is thought to be due to glucose consumption by the mass. 
    Radiologically, a small to medium-sized tumor appears as a solitary, sharply delineated, often lobulated nodule or mass of variable size from 1 to 39 cm, and forms obtuse angle with the chest wall. Large tumors can appear as opacifications of a portion of one hemithorax, and often forms acute angle with the chest wall as the mass is pedunculated or becomes larger than the pleural origin. LFTP exist in the costal compartment of pleura, within an interlobar fissure, along pleural surface of mediastinum, along the diaphragmatic pleura and rarely within the lung parenchyma. These tumor predominate in the middle and lower half of the chest. A pedunculated LFTP can change postion and appearance with respiration or with a change in position. Calcification have been reported in 7% of tumors. Pleural effusion was present in 8 - 17% of cases but is more likely to be associated with malignant tumors than the benign. On unenhanced CT scans, LFTPs are well-delineated, often lobulated soft-tissue attenuation mass. Calcifications are noted in large tumors and related to the areas of necrosis. The tumors have rich vascularization and shows intense and homogeneous enhancement. Nonenhancing areas on CT scans correspond to necrosis, myxoid degenration, or hemorrhage within the tumor. Identification of pedicle is a clue to the diagnosis. CT findings that suggest a malignant fibrous tumor include a diameter larger than 10 cm, central necrosis, and ipsilateral pleural effusion. MRI is superior to CT for the morphology of a tumor, the relationships of the tumor to adjacent structures and, characterization of tissue. Tumors are intermediate to low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and of low signal intensity on proton density-weighted and T2-weighted images. These findings relate to hypocellularity and abundant collagen stroma. Areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images are related to areas of necrosis or myxoid degeneration. Intense enhancement has been reported after injection of gadolinium. Recent fibrosis and malignant fibrosis show low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images because of increased vascularity, edema, and increased cellularity.  Contrast enhancement is also reported. Falaschi et al reported that mesothelioma, metastasis, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had high signal intensity on proton-density weighted images and T2-weighted images. Moreover benign lesions revealed low signal intensity on T2-weighted images.

HRCT scans show honeycombing in periphery of the both lung and a focal infiltration with spiculated margin and traction bronchiectasis, suggesting fibrotic mass in the right upper lobe anterior segment. Honeycomb cysts are also noted in the peripheral portions of the both lower lobes.","It is well recognized that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with lung cancer at a relatively high rate (about 14 times) compared with that of the general population without fibrosis. Lung cancer in IPF develops mostly in the peripheral portion and the lower lobe, where advanced fibrosis predominates. Squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma, which occurs mainly in the large bronchi, are frequently found in the peripheral region of the lung in the patient with IPF. However, this fact is not surprising, because squamous epithelial metaplasia and proliferation can also occur in the terminal airways. As to the peripheral origin, lung cancer with IPF is somewhat different from the so-called scar carcinoma of the lung. Namely, scar carcinoma occurs predominantly in the upper lobes and a relatively large population of this type is adenocarcinoma. 
    Chest radiographic findings of lung cancer associated with IPF are nodular, linear densities, or a honeycomb pattern.

Lateral radiograph shows anterosuperiorly displaced left major fissure with LUL atelectasis, inferiorly displaced right minor fissure with RML atelectasis, and inferiorly displaced upper half of right major fissure with RLL atelectasis. The bronchoscopic examination revealed tuberculous bronchostenosis of these bronchi. 
Obliterated bronchi of LUL, RML, and RLL are well visualized on 3D-reformated airway image (arrows). 
","In combined lobar atelectasis, the volumes of two lobes of a lung decrease simultaneously. Because the right lung has three lobes, three combinations of combined atelectasis are possible within the right hemithorax. The most frequent combination is that of RML and RLL atelectasis caused by obstruction of the bronchus intermedius. Less commonly seen are combined atelectasis of the RUL and RML, and combined RUL and RLL atelectasis. Because the bronchus intermedius is the common pathway to the RML and RLL, a single localized lesion involving the bronchus intermedius gives rise to combined atelectasis of these lobes. The bronchial obstruction can be caused by a tumor, a foreign body, a mucous plug, or an inflammatory stricture. 
    In combined RML and RLL atelectasis, the atelectatic RLL obscures the right hemidiaphragm, while the atelectatic RML obscures the right cardiac border on PA radiographs. Both the major and minor fissures are depressed by the hyperexpanding RUL, and the depression is most marked laterally. Interestingly, the two depressed fissures cross each other, the major fissure being more vertical in orientation to climb higher to meet the hilum, whereas the minor fissure extends laterally to reach the lateral costophrenic angle. On lateral view, the overinflated RUL fills the almost whole hemithorax, and the atelectatic RML and RLL manifest as a low-lying opacity which traverses from the front to the back of the thorax. Other signs of combined atelectasis of the RML and RLL include a small and depressed right hilum, decreased vascularity of a hyperexpanded RUL, mediastinal shift to the right, and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. On CT scans, the atelectatic RML and RLL occupy the lower hemithorax and abut the right cardiac border medially and the right hemidiaphragm inferiorly. 
    Complete combined RML and RLL atelectasis can be difficult to detect on PA and lateral radiographs. The diagnosis should be suspected in the patients with a small right hilum and an apparently oligemic right lung, which represents the hyperexpanded RUL.

In the study by Ren et al, nodular septal thickening was not noted in any pathologic specimens of patients with pulmonary edema, fibrosis, or in normal lungs. However, it is clear that the presence of nodular septal thickening is a nonspecific finding that reflects a perilymphatic distribution of abnormalities, also commonly seen in patients with sarcoidosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis or silicosis. In sarcoidosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis, although nodules are commonly seen, the septal thickening is usually less extensive than that seen in a patients with lymphatic spread of tumor. Moreover, in sarcoidosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis, distortion of lung architecture and secondary pulmonary lobular anatomy is common, particularly if septal thickening is present; this distortion is not seen in patients with PLC. On the other hand, the presence of pleural effusion would be more in keeping with PLC than sarcoidosis or silicosis. In pulmonary fibrosis, nodular septal thickening is uncommon and the margins of the thickened interlobular septa are irregular.

The presence of thick-walled cysts and fat or calcific densities is highly suggestive of mediastinal teratomas on CT. These tumors rarely rupture into the adjacent structures, such as the pleural space, pericardium, lung parenchyma, or tracheobronchial tree. Proteolytic or digestive enzymes derived from the tumor have been proposed as the cause of tumoral rupture. When the tumor is ruptured, these enzymes can cause inflammation and necrosis of adjacent organs. Prompt treatment of ruptured tumors is necessary because acute respiratory distress can develop. In addition, surgical management of ruptured tumors often is more complicated than that of unruptured tumors because internal components of the teratoma leak into the thoracic cavity, causing inflammation and adhesion. Therefore, preoperative diagnosis of ruptured teratoma is important for deciding the appropriate time for surgery and the plan of surgical approach. 
   Patients with mediastinal teratomas are usually asymptomatic (up to 53%). Severe symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea, or hemoptysis) were more commonly found in ruptured than in unruptured tumors. All ruptured mediastinal teratomas had a tendency to display inhomogeneity of the internal component, whereas 90% of unruptured masses showed homogenous densities of internal components in each compartment of the mass. Ancillary CT findings (such as a fat-containing mass, consolidation, or atelectasis in the adjacent lung) are important for detecting rupture in the mediastinal teratomas, although associated compressive atelectasis and pneumonitis in the adjacent lung also could be caused by large mass size. Pleural effusion was one of the most common ancillary CT findings (57%) in ruptured mediastinal teratomas.

It is unilateral in 98%, involves a single lobe in 95% and the lower lobes in 55%. They may be diagnosed on ultrasound antenatally. CT patterns of CCAM are a large solitay cyst, multiple cyst, areas of consolidation, and areas of low attenuation. Cysts of CCAM are fluid-filled, air-filled,  or air-fluid levels in cysts, a combination of these 
findings can result. The cysts expand because of collateral ventilation via cores of Kohn. Areas of consolidation  shows enhancement and correspond to areas of glandular or bronchiolar structure. Areas of low attenuation around cystic lesions are microcysts with thin-walled bronchiolelike structures blended with normal lunt parenchyma. Because of 
lack of cartilage in the involved airways, the malformed bronchi may collapse during expiration, predisposing to infection. 
  In neonates congenital diaphragmatic hernia and congenital lobar emphysema should be considered. Congenital lobar emphysema reveal the overdistended lobe with stretched and attenuated vascular structures. There are several other pulmonary abnormalities are included in the differential diagnosis. These include pneumothorax, pyopneumothorax, 
cystic bronchiectasis, intralobar pulmonary sequestration, intrapulmonary bronchogenic cyst, or prior infection with pneumatocele formation. Intralobar pulmonary sequestration occurs in the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, has a large arterial supply from the aorta and prominant obliterative changes of the blood vessels histologically. 
However overlapping CT features exist among these cases. The value of CT in the diagnosis of CCAM is to show the full extent of the disease not visible on the chest radiograph, thereby allowing accurate surgical planning. 
   Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Prognosis depends on the size of the lesion and its effect on pulmonary development(pulmonary hypoplasia), fetal hydrops, and associated congenital abnormalities.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-407-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-407-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-407-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-407-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-407-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-407-6.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-407-7.jpg']",23,"['correct:4/23', 'semi:15/23']"

5. Other mediastinal tumors","The esophageal leiomyoma accounts for 45 to 73 per cent of all benign esophageal tumors. Most frequently, esophageal leiomyomas occur in the lower third of the esophagus (60%) and are detected in early or middle adult life. Most leiomyomas are solitary tumors, but occasionally multiple tumors are present. Smooth muscle tumors (leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas) may grow to a substantial size without causing dysphagia and therefore may first appear as an asymptomatic mediastinal mass. Diagnosis by esophagography is usually straightforward; an intramural lesion producing a smooth crescent-shaped defect in the barium column. Now CT often is performed without preliminary barium swallow. CT shows a smooth, round, well-defined, enhancing mass, which may contain calcium, in the posterior mediastinum inseparable from the esophagus. The esophagus is usually not dilated above the level of the tumor. This lack of dilatation can be an important differential diagnostic point in reducing the likelihood of carcinoma of the esophagus. Preservation of adjacent fat planes and calcification also help to distinguish a benign leiomyoma from a carcinoma. Histologically, these tumors consist of intersecting bands of smooth muscle and fibrous tissue in a well-defined capsule. Unlike gastric leiomyomas, however, esophageal leiomyomas rarely undergo ulceration, so upper gastrointestinal bleeding is extremely uncommon. About 60% of these lesions are located in the distal third of the esophagus, 30% in the middle third, and 10% in the proximal third. Leiomyoma are less common above the level of the aortic arch because of the presence of striated rather than smooth muscle in this portion o the esophagus. These tumors appear grossly as discrete submucosal masses, usually ranging from 2 to 8 cm in size. Occasionally, however, the lesions may have an exophytic, intraluminal, or circumferential growth pattern.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-334-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-334-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-334-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-334-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-334-5.jpg']",19,[]

CT scans show multiple nodules with or without a halo of ground-glass attenuation in the peripheral lungs. Multiple small low attenuation nodules are also seen in the liver. On laboratory examinations, the number of eosinophil increased markedly in peripheral blood (50%) and 
BAL fluid (35%). Histopathologic examination in the lung and liver revealed infiltration of eosinophils in both the organs.","Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rarely encountered, infiltrative disease of eosinophils affecting multiple organs, including the lung. Criteria for the diagnosis include persistent eosinophilia of 1500 eosinophils/mm3 for longer than 6 months; absence of parasitic, allergic or other known causes of eosinophilia; and evidence of organ involvement. 
Virtually any organ system can be involved in HES, but the most severe clinicopathologic involvement is of the heart and nervous system. There is widespread tissue infiltration with mature eosinophils that cause tissue damage, particularly endocardial damage leading to endocardial fibrosis. Almost all patients have been men, typically young or middle-aged adult 
with progressive cardiopulmonary symptoms, skin rash, or myalgia together with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, weakness, fatigue, and fever. 
   Pulmonary involvement in HES occurs in up to 40% of patients and typically presents as cough or dyspnea. Patients with HES and pulmonary infiltrates may be attributed to infection, infarction, congestive heart failure or HES-related pulmonary involvement. One half of these patients have significant pleural effusion, and probably due to congestive heart failure or embolic phenomenon.

CT scan demonstrates nodules with or without a halo of ground-glass attenuation and focal areas of ground-glass attenuation in peripheral lung areas. Hilar lymphadenopathy has been noted, but the prevalence of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy has not

The right paravertebral mass shows widening of neural foramen with bony erosion. All of these are not well enhanced and show relatively low-density. And numerous protruding skin lesions are seen in entire chest wall. ","Classic neurofibromatosis (or von Recklinghausen’s disease) is a hereditary, autosomal dominant, hamartomatous disorder. Severeal types of neurofibromas occur in von Recklinghausen’s disease and are distinguished on the basis of their gross and microscopic appearances. The localized neurofibroma, the most common type, is a focal lesion that typically is located in the dermis and subcutis. The diffuse neurofibroma is localized in the subcutis, usually in the head and neck region. Plexiform neurofibromas, which are considered pathognomonic of von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis, usually occur in the neck, pelvis, and extremities, but they may be seen in virtually any location, including thorax. In the thorax, the sympathetic chains are most commonly involved. 
    Plexiform neurofibromas appear as a diffuse fusiform enlargment of the peripheral nerves and/or as multiple masses along the course of the peripheral nerves. Plexiform neurofibromas have a low attenuation compared with that of muscle tissue, with CT values ranging from 15 to 20 H on non-enhanced scans. The low attenuation of these lesions is related to the presence of the lipidic Schwann cells, the high water content of the mucinous matrix, entrapment of perineural adipose tissue, and cystic degeneration. Peripheral enhancement after administration of IV contrast material and calcifications may occur in neurofibromas and neurofibrosarcomas and are nonspecific findings. And lateral menigocele, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, thoracic skeletal deformaities (scoliosis with or without kyphosis), optic glioma, astrocytoma, acoustic neuroma and menigiomas are also developed in von Recklinghausen’s disease. 
    Lateral thoracic meningoceles are protrusion of the spinal meninges through the intervertebral foramina. They are detected in patients between 30 and 60 years of age. Approximately two thirds of cases occur in association with neurofibromatosis. Enlargement of the adjacent intervertebral foramen is an important diagnostic feature. This sign is identical to that seen with dumbbell nerve sheath tumors- a diagnostic problem complicated by the fact that both conditions are frequently associated with neurofibromatosis.

Because the mass was associated with definte bony destrcution, it was regarded to be malignant primary bony tumor or metastatic rib tumor. CT scans show an extrapleural soft tissue mass, originating from the axillary portion of the right 6th rib. Osteolytic bone destruction in the rib with new bone formation within the soft tissue mass is also seen. 
     The tumor was completely resected en bloc. About 4 x 4 x 5 cm sized, highly vascular mass containing area of necrosis with extension to soft tissue, was noted.  Pathological disgnosis was osteosarcoma, mainly osteoblastic type, originating from the right 6th rib. ","The most commonly encountered tumors of the ribs are metastatic lesions. Primary tumors of the ribs are less common and about two-thirds of the primary tumors are malignant. The primary tumors of the ribs occur in descending order of frequency as follows: Chondrosarcoma 30%, Lymphoma, Myeloma (multiple or solitary) 17%, Fibrous dysplasia 12%, Osteosarcoma 10%, Osteochondroma 8%, Ewing's sarcoma 6%, Eosinophilic granuloma 3%, and numerous rare tumors (Hemangioma, Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, Primitive neuroectodermal tumor in infancy, Parosteal chondroma, Chondroblastoma, Chondromyxoid fibroma, Giant cell tumor, Giant cell tumor of Paget's disease, Giant cell tumor of hyperparathyroidism, Nonossifying fibroma, Fibrous histiocytoma, Osteoid osteoma, Osteoblastoma, Aneurysmal bone cyst, fibrosarcoma, and angiosarcoma). 
     Metastatic carcinoma involves the thoracic skeleton via hematogeneous or lymphatic system or by direct extension. The most common primary tumors are breast, lung, prostate, thyroid, and kidney. Lymphoma may be centered in the rib, where they produce lytic destruction. 
     Chondrosarcoma is a tumor of adulthood, with the peak incidence of sixth decade. It commonly arises from the anterior costochondral or sternochondral junction of the upper four ribs. Secondary chondrosarcoma arises in the pre-existing enchondroma or osteochondroma. Radiologic features of malignant chondrosarcoma over a benign chondroma are ill-defined margins, cortical thickening, and breakthrough of the cortex. Amorphous, speckled calcification is a characteristic finding of chondroid matrix. 
    Ewing's sarcoma is primarily confined to the pediatric population, rare over 30 years old. The lesions are usually lytic, permeative appearance and produce lamellar periosteal reaction. Multiple myeloma expand the rib with complete erosion of cortex. Pathologic fractures are common. An enchondroma appears as a round or oval radiolucency, which may cause expansion of the bone and thinning of the cortex. Osteochondromas grow at right angles to the bone. The cortex of normal bone is continuous with the cortex of the osteochondroma. Fibrous dysplasia produce increased density or sclerosis, obscuring the normal definition of bony cortex. It can produce lytic lesions with thinning of the cortex and expansion of the rib. 
     Osteosarcoma(osteogenic sarcoma)  constitute 40% of all primary malignant neoplasm of bone. Most patients are between the ages of 10 and 25 years and male to female ratio is 2 : 1. The proliferating tumor cells produce osteoid or immature bone. The most typical sites of involvement are metaphyses of the  tubular bones in the appendicular skeleton (80%), particularly the femur (40%), the tibia (16%), and the humerus (15%). Osteosarcomas are relatively infrequent in the fibula, innominate bone, mandible, maxilla & spine and are rare in the skull, ribs, scapula, clavicle, sternum, radius, ulna, and small bones of hands and feet.

Precontrast CT scan shows a well-defined, homogeneous, and slightly high attenuation mass just left lateral to the trachea. Post-contrast enhanced CT scans demonstrate the cystic portion within the highly enhancing mass, which is continuous with the lower pole of left thyroid gland. Tc99m TcO4 thyroid scan (not shown here) demonstrated massive enlargement and uneven uptake in the left lobe of thyroid gland. Operation and pathologic examination revealed it as a 7 x 7cm-sized nonfunctioning goiter of cervicothoracic type.","Goiters in the superior mediastinum arise from one or both lower poles of the thyroid gland or from the isthmus. With growth of the goiter, aided by deglutition, gravity, and negative intrathoracic pressure, the goiter enters the thorax, generally taking its cervical blood supply with it. Intrathoracic goiters can be classified primary and secondary. The presence of vascular stalks with cervical thyroid gland makes intrathoracic goiter secondary, while absence of in, primary (or ectopic). Primary intrathoracic goiters are very rare, with a reported incidence of 0.2 to 1 per cent of all goiters. Although clear continuity between the cervical and intrathoracic components should be present in cases of mediastinal goiter extension, the connection may only be a narrow fibrous or vascular pedicle. In such cases, as well as in the presence of a primary intrathoracic goiter, lack of continuity between the cervical gland and the thoracic mass does not exclude goiter as the diagnosis. Pathologically the nontoxic nodular goiter has distended follicles with colloid and hyperplasia of the thyroid tissue. The follicles can rupture with resultant inflammatory changes, and ultimate degeneration can occur with hemorrhage, infarction, fibrosis, cyst formation, and calcification. Normal thyroid tissue has higher attenuation values than soft tissue because of its high iodine content and shows intense postcontrast enhancement. The high attenuation of an intrathoracic goiter may depend on the density of iodine per unit volume and the extent of degeneration. The typical CT features of intrathoracic goiter can be summarized as follows: 1. continuity with the cervical thyroid gland, 2. well-defined borders, 3. punctate, coarse, or ringlike calcifications, 4. nonhomogeneity often with minimal or nonenhancing, well defined, low-density areas, 5. precontrast attenuation values often at least 15 H greater than adjacent musculature with at leas 25 H enhancement after intravenous contrast, 6. patterns of extension of the goiter into the mediastinum with cradling of the goiter by the right and left bracheocephalic vessels high in the mediastinum and extension behind the great vessels to the paratracheal or retrotracheal region.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-336-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-336-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-336-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-336-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-336-5.jpg']",34,"['correct:24/34', 'semi:8/34']"

Postcontrast CT scans, obtained at the lower pole of right thyroid gland and thoracic inlet level, demonstrate a well-defined heterogeneously enhancing mass, which displaces the trachea and left carotid artery. MR T1-weighted sagittal image also shows a slightly hypointense mass in thoracic inlet.","Deviation of the trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet is a common finding on routine chest radiographs. In the vast majority of cases in adults, it is secondary to a mass of thyroid origin: a cyst, adenoma, carcinoma, or goiter. But rarely, other tumors (including ectopic thymomas like this case) will produce similar findings on the chest radiograph. 
    The thymus is the central organ of an infant’s lymphoid system, originating in the third and possibly the fourth branchial pouches and reaching its definitive location in the mediastinum after a process of descent, generally leaving no trace behind. Occasionally, during this descent, remnants of thymic tissue can be implanted along the cervical pathway, representing the so-called ectopic or aberrant cervical thymus (1). 
    Thymoma arising from aberrant cervical thymus in the neck is very rare and is an unusual cause of asymptomatic neck mass in adults. The most common extrathoracic location is the vicinity of the thyroid. Aberrant cervical thymoma usually manifests as mass lesions at the thoracic inlet, with superior displacement of the thyroid (2, 3).

There is no detectable mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, and no metastatic focus.","Thymic carcinoid is a rare neoplasm of neuroendocrine origin, generally hormonally active, with a tendency toward malignant degeneration. Almost 50% of thymic carcinoids are associated with endocrinopathies, usually Cushing syndrome as a result of ACTH secretion, and 19% of the tumor may be associated with other neoplasms, such as parathyroid adenoma, islet cell tumor of the pancreas, and pituitary adenoma when it is part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia(MEN) type I. In case not associated with endocrine dysfunction, the tumor may be detected because of local symptoms or routine chest radiography. The age range of reported patients with thymic carcinoid is nine to 87 years, with the preponderance occurring in middle-aged men, in contrast to the female preponderance of epithelial thymoma. Chest radiographic findings are often normal or equivocal. However, CT scans show an irregular soft-tissue mass with inhomogeneous contrast enhancement. The differential diagnosis of a mass in the anterior mediastinum in a patient without clinical signs and symptoms of an endocrinopathy includes thymoma, lymphoma, and germ-cell tumors, but a non-functioning neuroendocrine tumor, such as thymic carcinoid can not be excluded. Thymic carcinoid have a relatively poor prognosis, and recurrence and extrathoracic metastasis (skin, bone, and lymph nodes) are common. Osteoblastic metastasis is typical of carcinoid. Surgical excision of the primary tumor and of subsequent recurrences seems to be the most effective treatment. However, the length of survival after initial diagnosis is widely variable, from one to 15 years.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is recognized as the most common viral pathogen to cause substantial morbidity and mortality in patients with marrow transplantation. Patients with CMV pneumonia may have nonproductive cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, or fever, with a median onset of 60 days after marrow transplant. Onset within the first two weeks is unusual. The period of risk of CMV pneumonia generally ends by approximately the fourth or fifth month after transplant. Chest radiograph generally shows bilateral infiltrates; in later stages, diffuse consolidation occurs. Unilateral, focal, and even nodular infiltrates have been seen in the early stages.

Focal bulging of the proximal right interlobar artery is also suspected. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is seen, suggesting pleural thickening with or without small effusion. 
Chest CT scans demonstrate mild dilatation of the left interlobar artery with low-density thrombus at the peripheral portion of the lumen. Dilatation with thrombus was also noted in the right interlobar artery (not shown here). Multiple ill-defined airspace nodules are also noted in both lower lobes, and one of them in left lower lobe has cavity. A low-attenuation material (probable thrombus) is seen within the right ventricle. On abdominal CT scan, saccular aneurysm is present in the abdominal aorta. ","Behcet's disease is a rare form of vasculitis of obscure etiology. Any large or small artery, vein, or organ may be involved in an unpredictable combination. According to the criteria set by the International Study Group for Behcet's Disease, the diagnosis is based on the presence of recurrent oral ulcers plus two of the following: 
recurrent genital ulcers, eye lesions (anterior or posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis), skin lesions (erythema nodosum, pseudofolliculitis, papulopustular lesions, acneiform nodules), or a positive pathergy test (pustule formation 24-48 hr after skin prick). Patients are usually 20-30 years old at the time of onset of the disease. The prevalence is considerably higher in Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, and the Far East than in the rest of the world. 
Intrathoracic manifestation of Behcet's disease consist mainly of thromboembolism of the superior vena cava and/or other mediastinal veins; aneurysm of aorta and pulmonary arteries; pulmonary infarct and hemorrhage; pleural effusion; and, rarely, myocardial or pericardial involvement, cor pulmonale, and mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. 
    Chest radiography is the best diagnostic method for evaluating thoracic involvement in Behcet's disease, and shows mediastinal widening, air-space consolidation, and lung mass. Sudden hilar enlargement or intraparenchymal round opacities is a sign of pulmonary artery aneurysm. CT scan shows that that mediastinal widening was due to 
thrombosis or narrowing of the superior vena cava which caused mediastinal edema; that air-space consolidation was due to pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction; and that lung mass was due to aneurysm of the right or left pulmonary artery. They may recur, progress, or resolve, either spontaneously, within a few weeks to several months, or with corticosteroid therapy. Although no comparative studies are available, CT and MR angiography appear to be imaging techniques of choice for evaluating vascular involvement. CT also can demonstrate pulmonary parenchymal changes such as air-space nodules, cavities, and mosaic areas of lung attenuation. 
Recently, helical CT findings of pulmonary artery aneurysms during treatment for Behcet¡?s disease were reported. Pulmonary artery aneurysms may become smaller or disappear with medical treatment. Mural thrombotic changes may be observed during the regression of pulmonary artery aneurysms. Perianeurysmal consolidation and 
air-space nodules, and mosaic attenuation areas may disappear during or after treatment. 
    Differential diagosis includes Hughes-Stovin syndrome that has indentical histologic and clinical features except for oral and genital ulcers. Both Reiter's syndrome and relapsing polychondritis may complicated by aortitis and aortic aneurysms with some overlapping clinical features. Arterial narrowings and occlusions, producing symptoms 
of vascular insufficiencies in Behcet's disease, may clinically mimic Takayasu's arteritis.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-431-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-431-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-431-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-431-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-431-5.jpg']",23,"['correct:10/23', 'semi:2/23']"

Enhanced CT scan demonstrates irregular parietal pleural thickening and medial displacement of the calcified pleura due to enhancing nodular mass, lateral to the parietal pleura. Extrapleural fat is also thickened. The extrapleural mass extends into the chest wall through the intercostal space.","The association of malignancy with long-standing pleuritis or empyema, especially tuberculous empyema, is occasional. The range of neoplasms is wide and includes non-Hodgkin lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, mesothelioma, and rarely sarcoma (1). As for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Iuchi et al (2) reported that it occurred in 2.2% of patients with chronic empyema. Almost malignant lymphomas were B-cell NHL. Detection of malignancy near the empyema cavity is difficult in most cases. Early detection of malignancy associated with chronic empyema by means of plain chest radiographs alone is still more difficult because the tumor shadows are hidden by broad radiopaque areas of empyema cavities in most cases. However, several findings, such as increase in extent of radiopaque areas in the thoracic cavity, soft tissue bulgings and/or unsharpness of the fat planes in the chest wall, destruction of bone near the empyema, and extensive medial displacement of the calcified pleurae, especially of the parietal pleura, suggest the diagnosis (3). New recurrence of an air-fluid level in the empyema cavity is also another important finding. When patients with longstanding empyema complain of symptoms or their chest radiographs reveal some changes in abnormal findings, CT is essential. CT can demonstrate an abnormal mass with soft tissue attenuation around the empyema and usually shows contrast enhancement in the mass. The most important differential diagnosis is exacerbation of empyema, especially formation of empyema necessitatis. To differentiate the malignancy from exacerbation of the empyema, it is important to examine the shape of a mass with soft tissue attenuation, irregularity of the thickeness of the wall, and existence of projections in the cavity. The pathogenesis of this entity has been the subject of many hypotheses but is still undetermined.

Fibrous dysplasia is usually a slowly progressive, benign disease that develops over several years and presents with deformity or mild symptoms. It is a benign disorder of bone that can cause cortical thinning as well as bony expansion. On conventional radiography, aggressive fibrous dysplasia may produce opacification and expansion of the underlying bone and apparent disruption of its wall with an associated soft tissue mass.

There is often a prodromal illness associated with symptoms of a viral upper respiratory infection, followed by rapidly increasing dyspnea and respiratory failure. AIP was described in 1986 by Katzenstein et al. in eight patients. The patients presented with symptoms of acute respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation within 1 to 2 weeks from onset of symptom. Seven of the eight patients died within six months, and one recovered. The pathologic abnormalities consisted of thickening of the alveolar walls due to edema, inflammatory cells, and active fibroblast proliferation but little mature collagen deposition. There was extensive alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation. They emphasized that this condition, which they called acute interstitial pneumonia, is clinically and pathologically distinct from UIP and DIP, which accounts for the majority of cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. because the acute presentation and the histologic features are identical with those of ARDS, AIP has also been referred to as idiopathic ARDS. Primack et al. reviewed the radiographic and HRCT findings in nine patients with acute interstitial pneumonia.

Bronchoscopic biopsy of the tracheal nodule revealed squamous cell carcinoma.","Primary malignant neoplasms of the trachea are uncommon, accounting for less than 1% of all thoracic malignancies. The most common primary tracheal malignancies are squamous cell carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. Less common tumors include mucoepidermoid and carcinoid tumors. As for tracheal carcinoma, average age of the patients is about 55 yr, and there is male preponderance. Hemoptysis is commonly the first symptom of tracheal carcinoma, but the patient may present with dyspnea, wheezing, or dysphagia. Most of the patients have stridor. Grossly, the tumor may be exophytic, infiltrative, or ulcerated. It may arise from any level in the trachea, and involve only a short segment or extent along the wall for a considerable distance. All histologic varieties are encountered; squamous cell carcinoma is the most common, adenocarcinoma and oat cell carcinoma less frequent. 
    Invasion of the mediastinal soft tissues, spread to lymph nodes, and extension into the esophagus are common. Seeding into the lung via the bronchial tree occasionally occurs. Most often the spread is via the hematogenous route to lung, bone, liver, or brain. Radiographically the tumor is usually irregular, lobulated, or annular; most are located above the aortic arch.

CT scans show a mass-like air space consolidation with internal necrotic low attenuation in the right lower lobe. Note the ground glass opacity around the mass-like consolidation.","Invasive aspergillosis is the most common opportunistic pulmonary fungal infection, followed by candidiasis and mucormycosis. Major risk factors for invasive aspergillosis include severe or prolonged neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 500), prolonged corticosteroid therapy, graft-versus-host disease after allogenic BMT, and late-stage AIDS. Infection begins when aerosolized spores are inhaled into the distal airways and air spaces. In the absence of an effective host immune response, the spores mature into hyphae that can invade the pulmonary arteries. This results in pulmonary arterial thrombosis, hemorrhage, lung necrosis, and systemic dissemination. affected patients report nonspecific symptoms of fever, cough, and dyspnea. symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism can also occur. The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is difficult because the organism can normally colonize the upper airway. Thus, although single positive sputum cultures are considered unreliable for diagnosis, repeatedly positive cultures in a patient with fever and neutropenia suggest the diagnosis. As many of these patients are thrombocytopenic, invasive diagnostic procedures such as percutaneous or transbronchial biopsy may be precluded. Cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are positive in 30% to 68% of infected patients. Mortality rates from infection are high (50% to 70%), and patient outcomes depend on the early institution of antifungal therapy, the severity of the underlying disease, and the speed of granulocyte recovery. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis characteristically manifests on radiographs as multiple, ill-defined 1 to 3 cm peripheral nodules that gradually coalesce into larger masses or areas of consolidation. An early computed tomography finding, best seen with thin collimation, is a rim of ground glass opacity surrounding the nodules (CT halo sign). This finding is nonspecific and has also been described in patients with tuberculosis, mucormycosis, and Wegener granulomatosis. In the appropriate clinical setting, however, the CT halo sign is highly suggestive of fungal infection, usually aspergillosis. Cavitation in the nodules or masses occurs in 40% of affected patients and often has a distinctive radiographic appearance, the air-crescent sign. This finding is characterized by an intracavitary mass composed of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, occurs after granulocyte recovery, and usually indicates a good prognosis. Lobar or diffuse pulmonary consolidation are common, less specific findings. Pleural effusion is uncommon, and adenopathy is rare. Chest wall or mediastinal invasion can occur, and systemic dissemination to the central nervous system, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract occurs in 25% to 50% of patients.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-314-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-314-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-314-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-314-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-314-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-314-6.jpg']",31,"['correct:24/31', 'semi:1/31']"

Note the homogenous low density of the mass. The pulmonary vascular structures are visible through the mass because of the low density of the mass, meaning probable fat component within the mass. CT scan shows a large mass in the left side of the anterior mediastinum with compressed left lower lobe. The mass composes largely of fatty tissue and some streaky soft tissue portion. The history of chest pain and weight loss (10kg / 6 months) suggests malignant nature of the lesion.","Primary mediastinal liposarcomas are rare tumors, composed largely of fat.  Histologic differentiation between a lipoma and well differentiated liposarcoma depends on presence of mitotic activity, cellular atypia, fibrosis, neovascularization, and tumor infiltration. Patients more than 40 years old are at a higher risk of having this tumor. Liposarcomas can become large, and clinical symptoms result from compression and displacement of adjacent mediastinal structures. Common symptoms are dyspnea, chest pain, cough, and weight loss. Histologically, four main types of liposarcoma can be distinguished: the well-differentiated type, the myxoid type, the round cell type, and the pleomorphic type. In adults, the myxoid type is the most common form, accounting for 40-50% of the histologic subtypes. 
    On CT, liposarcomas usually show a homogenous appearacne, although areas of calcificagtion and ossification can be seen, especially in the myxoid cell type. Normal fat shows a low attenuation level (-70 to -130 H), whereas the attenuation of liposarcoma is higher because of the composition (fat and soft tissue) of these fatty tumors. Well-differentiated tumors have a CT attenuation greater than that of fat, whereas poorly differentiated liposarcomas, which are more cellular with less fat per cell, have CT attenuation similar to other solid tumors (+15 to +25H). CT findings suggesting liposarcoma include (a) inhomogeneous attenuation, with evidence of significant amounts of soft-tissue within the fatty mass, (b) poor definition of adjacent mediastinal structures, (c) evidence of infiltration or invasion of mediastinal structures. However, the diagnosis of a liposarcoma is often difficult using CT. The MR appearance of fatty tissue has been well described. Typically, fat has a high SI on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences, appearing identical to subcutaneous fat. However unfortunately, MRI has proven no more accurate than CT in differentiating liposarcoma from benign lipomas.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-339-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-339-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-339-3.jpg']",32,"['correct:4/32', 'semi:6/32']"

","Legionnaires' disease is caused by Legionella pneumophilia; an aerobic gram-negative bacillus found in aquatic environments such as reservoirs, cooling towers, water distribution systems, and humidifiers. Predisposing chronic diseases are common and may be either pulmonary or systemic. Corticosteroid therapy is a recognized  risk factor. 
    The initial chest radiographic finding is peripherally situated patchy consolidation, which spreads rapidly, often involving more than one lobe and becoming bilateral in half the cases, often despite the institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy. The consolidations may assume a spherical configuration or may coalesce to resemble lobar pneumonia. There may be a slight predilection for the lower lobes. In immunocompetent patients, abscess formation and subsequent cavitation is infrequent, but cavitation is seen fairly frequently in immunocompromised patients. The interval between the first evidence of infection and cavitation ranges from 4 to 14 days. Pleural effusions, which are usually small but occasionally massive, are documented in up to two thirds of cases at the peak of the illness, and frank empyema formation may occur. Hilar or mediastinal lymph node enlargement is not a feature of Legionnaires' disease. With appropriate therapy, roentgenographic resolution may be  fairly rapid but is often prolonged. The changes may persist for at least a month after the acute illness. The organism is difficult to culture from sputum and blood, and selective culture media are required. The diagnosis is usually established serologically by an indirect fluorescent antibody test.

Pulmonary edema localized to the right upper lobe occasionally has been observed in patients with mitral incompetence. It is believed that back flow across the incompetent mitral valve is directed at the orifice of the right upper lobe pulmonary vein This raises pulmonary venous pressures and increases pulmonary edema in that lobe (1). Pulmonary edema accompanying mitral regurgitation should be suspected whenever right upper lobe consolidation develops in a patient with known or suspected mitral valve disease. The presence of interstitial edema in the remainder of the lungs can help in the differentiation of this condition from pneumonia and other disorders.

These include M. kansasii, M. avium-intracellulare, M. fortuitum, M. xenopi, M. chelonae, and M. simiae.

- It appears that M. avium-intracellulare and M. kansasii are the most common pathogens in immunocompromised hosts. The incidence of MOTT in the non-HIV-infected population is approximately 2/100,000 population, probably remained fairly stable because infection occurs from the natural environment and not by person-to-person transmission.

- The organisms have a prediction for individuals with preexisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or with debilitating illnesses or various forms of immunocompromise. An interesting association has been observed with achalasia of gastric cardia and M. fortuitum / chelonae infection. Presumably these organisms flourish in the dilated obstructed esophagus and heavily seed the lungs during episodes of aspiration. One of the problems in the study of the clinical and radiologic manifestations of MOTT infection has been that these organisms may occurs as incidental contaminants.

- The classic features of MOTT infections of the lung are those of chronic indolent fibrocavitary processes. In many instances, the radiographic features are indistinguishable from those of reactivation of M. tuberculosis. The response to antituberculous therapy may be poor, and a seemingly inexorable progression of the disease over a period of years is common.

Contrast-enhanced chest CT and 3D reconstruction images (Fig. 2, 3, and 4 ) demonstrate an intraluminal polypoid mass arising from posterior wall with near total obstruction of the tracheal lumen.","Primary tracheal tumors are uncommon, accounting for less than 0.1% of all deaths due to carcinoma. Most primary tracheal tumors in adults ( 50% or more ) are malignant. Squamous cell carcinoma ( 54.5% ) is the most frequent. Adenoid cystic carcinoma ( 18% ) is the second most common primary tumor of the trachea. 

Adenoid cystic carcinoma appears to be unrelated to smoking. There is no gender predilection, and the average age of patients is the 5th decade. Symptoms are usually related to airway obstruction. Dyspnea and hemoptysis may occur. Wheezing is a frequent symptom. Patients may be incorrectly diagnosed and treated as asthmatics.

The radiologic appearance of the tumors can be divided into intraluminal wall thickening and exophytic forms. Intraluminal form of the tumors are intraluminal, hemispheric masses limited in spread to the tracheal wall. Wall thickening type manifest as diffuse wall thickening by infiltration of the tumor, and the thickened part presents as either a flat or spindle-shaped mass along the tracheal wall. The exophytic form is radiologically characterized by the extratracheal tumor.   

Bronchoscopy is a complementary procedure for diagnosis. The chief advantage of imaging is the demonstration of tracheal wall thickening and extraluminal changes. CT is valuable in demonstrating the primary tumor and its extent. Extraluminal growth in the transverse plane, a common feature of adenoid cystic carcinoma, is present. Its greatest usefulness appears to be in the detection of distant metastases. CT can not predict invasion of local structures. Contrast material is not useful in improving visualization of fat planes between mediastinal tumor and the aorta. CT underestimates the extent of the tumor in the longitudinal plane. Adenoid cystic carcinoma may grow submucosally without producing a distinct mass.

Pathologically, adenoid cystic carcinoma may infiltrate through the fibrous membrane between adjacent cartilage plates into the peritracheal tissue. Perineural or intraneural infiltration, as well as pericardial, great vessel, or pulmonary hilar involvement may occur. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes may be present in 10% of the cases at the initial diagnosis of tumor. Distant metastases may occur  in the lungs, liver, abdomen, lymph nodes or bones. 

The treatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma is surgical resection and anastomosis. Criteria for inoperability include excessive longitudinal extent, macroscopic mediastinal nodal metastases, distant metastatic deposits, and direct invasion of contiguous mediastinal structures such as the aorta and the esophagus. When surgery is not indicated, usually because of extensive local disease or metastases, radiation therapy is recommended. Because of the recurrent tendency of this tumor, the eventual outcome of ""curative"" surgery is difficult to predict.

Five-year and 10-year survivals are excellent, 79% and 57% respectively. However, the long-term outcome is poor due to late local recurrences ( 27% ) and late distant metastatic spread ( 55% ) occurring after a median time interval  of 24-180 months after surgery.

On CT scan, the lesion is located just posterior to the right major fissure and shows slightly lobulated margin anteriorly. 

On enhanced scan, the attenuation value of the nodule is similar to that of chest wall muscle.

On pathology (below), the nodule was composed of fibroblasts, collagen and inflammatory cells, mainly of lymphocyte and plasma cells.","Pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumor is an uncommon, non-neoplastic, occasionally aggressive proliferative process that may begin as an organizing pneumonia. 

It has many synonyms, including plasma cell granuloma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, histiocytoma, xanthoma, fibroxanthoma, xanthogranuloma, plasma cell tumor, fibrous xanthoma, xanthomatous pseudotumor, and plasma cell-histiocytoma complex. 
And the term inflammatory pseudotumor has been widely accepted. 

Gross pathology demonstrates that pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumors are typically well-defined, firm, lobulated parenchymal nodule or mass with a whorled and often heterogeneous appearance on cut section. 

The histologic findings are proliferation of spindle-shaped fibroblasts and permeation of collagen with lymphocytes, fibrosis, granulomatous inflammation, lymphoid hyperplasia, and intraalveolar fibrosis at the edge of the tumor. 

Pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumor is typically a solitary, peripheral, sharply circumscribed, lobulated mass with an anatomic bias for the lower lobes. 

CT most commonly shows a well-marginated, lobulated mass of heterogeneous attenuation with variable patterns of contrast enhancement and calcification. 

T1-weighted MR images typically show a heterogeneous mass of intermediate signal intensity that displays a nonspecific increase in signal intensity on T2-weighted images. 

Extraparenchymal extension and primary involvement of mediastinal and hilar structures are unusual. 

Calcification within the lesion is uncommon, but not rare. 

The tumor occurs more frequently in children than in adults. 

Atelectasis and pleural effusion may occur. 

Cavitation and lymphadenopathy are rare. 

The radiologic differential diagnosis for pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumor is extensive because the typical lesion may be characterized as a solitary pulmonary nodule or mass. 

A primary or metastatic neoplasm should be considered, but in children without an underlying malignancy, a solitary peripheral pulmonary nodule or mass is more likely to represent an inflammatory pseudotumor than a neoplasm.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-77-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-77-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-77-3.jpg']",13,['semi:2/13']

- Contrast-enhanced mediastinal setting CT scan shows strong enhancement of one of the nodules.

- These findings suggest multiple AVM nidus with a feeding artery and a draining vein.","1. Congenital pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM, arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous aneurysm) is considered to be caused by a defect in the terminal capillary loops that results in dilatation and the formation of thin-walled vascular sacs. 

2. About 40 to 65 % of patients have AV communications elsewhere, including the skin, mucous membranes, and other organs. This condition, known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or Rendu-Osler-Weber disease, is of simple, dominant transmission and not sex-linked.

3. Although it is assumed that the vascular defects are present at birth, they are seldom manifested clinically until adult life when the vessels have been subjected to pressure over several decades.

4. Grossly, pulmonary AVMs appear as spherical, vascular masses ranging in diameter from 1 mm to several centimeters just beneath the pleura or adjacent to bronchovascular bundles.

5. AVM are supplied and drained by several vessels, the draining veins usually being somewhat larger than the feeding arteries.

6. Radiologic Findings of AVM

- most common in the lower lobes. 
- single in two thirds, and multiple in a third of cases. 
- round or oval, somewhat lobulated in contour, but sharply defined. 
- calcification in some cases (phleboliths). 
- on CT scan, feeding arteries and draining veins are easily identified.

- Occurs twice as frequently in women as in men and usually are not recognized until the third or fourth decade of life. 
- May be asymptomatic but often complain of hemoptysis or dyspnea. 
- Signs include cyanosis, finger clubbing, and contunuous murmur or bruit audible over the lesion. 
- Because of strong association with hereditary telangiectasia, extrathoracic manifestations of disease also are fairly common. (epistaxis, telengiectasis in the skin or mucous membranes,, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage)

2) in the sympathetic chain in posterior mediastinum; and 
3) in or adjacent to the heart. 

4. Approximately one third of mediastinal paragangliomas are nonfunctioning and asymptomatic. The remainder show symptoms, sign, and laboratory findings of excess catecholamine production. 

5. The various paragangliomas appear similar on chest radiography, CT, and angiography. 
They are seen as rounded soft tissue masses that are usually hypervascular and therefore enhance brightly at CT after IV administration of contrast media. 
Arteriography reveals enlarged feeding vessels, pathologic vessels with the tumor, and an intense tumor blush.

2. The incidence of PCP in immunocompromised patients who do not have AIDS has been increasing, with mortality in this population approaching 50%. 

3. The most characteristic appearance on chest radiographs is the finding of diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates and/or ill-defined hazy consolidation.

4. HRCT findings are known as patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities, often central or perihilar. 

5. In addition to diffuse and bilateral disease, a distinct mosaic pattern has been described, with areas of normal lung intervening between focal areas of parenchymal involvement. 

6. In the patient we describe, the distribution of the radiographically visible PCP was atypical. The lungs that were included in the radiation port were spared. Infiltrates only appear in nonirradiated lung as the ""photographic negative of post-radiation pneumonia"" on chest radiograph and HRCT scans. It was clearly influenced by the radiation therapy. 

7. Forrest previously reported two cases of PCP in which lung irradiated approximately 3 and 12 months earlier remained free of infiltrates. He suggested that the irradiated lung tissue did not support the growth of Pneumocystis carinii. The Pneumocystis organism is very sensitive to its environment. It has not been cultured and, with rare exception, is only found in the alveolar air spaces and nearby pulmonary interstitium. 

8. The extreme sensitivity of the organism makes it likely that altered lung tissue might not support its growth. This is confirmed in cases where previously radiation has damaged certain lung fields. The fibrotic lung was almost free of disease while the rest of the lung was heavily infected at postmortem examination. 

9. To our knowledge, only one case was reported by Panicek et al. in which radiation therapy had altered the distribution of PCP infiltrates developing during the therapy. Our case, and those reported by Panicek et al. and Forrest, document that Pneumocystis infiltrates may spare lung included in a radiation port either during the course of therapy or months after its completion. 

10. It is unknown how frequently such sparing occurs, or whether such sparing occurs with organisms other than Pneumocystis carinii.

Patchy areas of ground-glass opacity are sometimes seen in HRCT images of patients with sarcoidosis (1). 

The results of correlation with pathologic specimen suggest that areas of ground-glass opacity usually are due to the presence of extensive interstitial sarcoid granulomas rather than alveolitis.

Dilated, tortuous branching vessel is seen in the medial aspect of vascular mass, considered dilated left subclavian artery. 

MRA shows a kink in the course of the aorta without actual narrowing, which is consistent with pseudocoarctation of aorta. The abnormally located, dilated left subclavian artery is well visualized.","Pseudocoarctation of the aorta is relatively rare congenital anomaly consisting of redundancy of the aortic arch without significant obstruction. 

Unlike coarctation, however, there is no obstruction of blood flow and therefore little or no demonstrable pressure gradient and no evidence of collateral circulation. 

Pseudocoarctation is usually asymptomatic, but they often are found to have high blood pressure. A systolic murmur also may be present. Anomalies associated with pseudocoarctation include bicuspid aortic valve, patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect, corrected transposition, aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva, aortic stenosis, Turner syndrome, megacalyces, coexistent true coarctation, and dilatation and tortuosity of the left subclavian artery. 

Chest PA shows a typical appearance. A homogeneous left upper, mediastinal, soft tissue mass is located above and behind what appears to be a normal but often low-lying the aortic knob. The mass is composed of the redundant segment of the aorta forming a pseudoaortic knuckle end on. 

CT findings in pseduocoarctation of the aorta are as follows; 
1) demonstration that the abnormal mass in the mediastinum is part of the aorta; 
2) an unusual aortic arch high in the mediastinum; 
3) visualization of the isthmic portion of the descending thoracic aorta not adjacent of the spine but rather ventral to it, and surrounded by aerated lung; 
4) more caudal origin of the subclavian artery. 

Angiography is diagnostic in those cases where the entire course of the aorta is clearly outlined. There is anterior and medial displacement of the distal aortic arch with a kink in the posterior and lateral margins of the aorta. The lumen of the aorta at the level of the kink may or may not be narrowed. If any narrowing appears to be present, it is not hemodynamically significant since collateral circulation is absent. MRA would be promising technique that replaces the role of angiography.

Contrast-enhanced chest CT scans reveal a well-defined ovoid endobronchial mass with distal atelectasis of right lower lobe.","Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the tracheobronchial tree is a rare airway tumor, comprising only 0.1 - 0.2 percent of the primary lung malignancies [1 - 5]. 
The tumor is believed to originate from the minor salivary glands lining the tracheobronchial tree [6]. 

The term ""bronchial adenoma"" has been used to describe a group of slow-growing neoplasms, many of which arise from the bronchial glands, including adenoid cystic carcinomas, mucoepidermoid carcinomas, and mixed tumors, and carcinoid tumors [1]. 
Since these tumors are usually low-grade malignancies rather than benign neoplasms, the term ""bronchial adenoma"" is a misnomer and should be discarded.

Histologically, mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the tracheobronchial tree consists of variable proportions of mucus-secreting cells, squamous cells, and so-called intermediate cells that show no particular differentiating characteristics [1]. The tumor is pathologically classified into low- and high-grade malignancy.

Radiographic manifestations of 58 cases of tracheobronchial mucoepidermoid carcinoma reviewed by Yousem and Hochholzer consisted of a solitary nodule or mass in 41 (70%) and ""pneumonic consolidation"" in 16 (29%) (one case showed no abnormality on chest radiograph) [6, 7]. 

According to a review of twelve cases of mucoepidermoid carcinoma by Kim et al (8), it is more commonly seen in the segmental bronchus rather than in the trachea or the main bronchus. (distal trachea [n = 1], main [n = 2], lobar [n = 1], or segmental [n = 8] bronchus)  


On chest radiographs, the tumor appears as a central mass with or without postobstructive pneumonia/ peripheral atelectasis or solitary pulmonary nodule. 


Prediction of endoluminal location of the tumor is plausible at CT, even when the tumor is located within the segmental bronchus. 


1. It appears as a sharply-marginated ovoid or lobulated intraluminal mass adapting to the branching features of the airways. 

2. Postobstructive pneumonia or distal bronchial dilatation with mucoid impaction is frequently associated.

Precontrast chest CT scan shows a mass of 7 cm in diameter with areas of low attenuation (ranging -30 to 0 Hounsfield Unit).  Postcontrast CT scan shows areas of inhomogenous contrast enhancement in the tumor component abuting the chest wall.  Pleural effusion was observed in right upper hemithorax.  

Gradient echo fast coronal MR image showed linear streaks and whorls of lower signal intensity arranged radially from the lateral chest wall, which corresponded with the area of contrast enhancement on CT scan.  Pleural effusion was well demonstrated in right apical and posterlateral costophrenic region separeted by the mass.

Right thoracotomy with resection of the tumor was done. Yellow-whitish and myxoid material was found to leak from  small tear of the well-encapsulated tumor.  The mass was easily separated from the mediastinum, but tightly attached on the posterolateral aspect of the inner surface of the chest wall in the size of 4cm in range which was considered as the origin of the tumor.  

Gross pathologic examination showed a well-encapsulated tumor composed of lipoblastomatous tissue with focal myxoid matrix.  Intratumoral loose fibrovascular connective tissue were arranged radially from the the chest wall side of the tumor, which was well correlated with coronal MR images.  The patient had immediate expansion of right lung and an uneventful postoperative course.","Lipoblastomas are rare benign mesenchymal tumors of embryonic white fat occurring in infancy and early childhood.  Among the soft tissue tumors in the first year of life, it occupies only 3 % [1,2].  Approximately two thirds of them are found in the extremities [1, 2].
     Occasionally the lipoblastoma arises in the neck, mediastinum, chest wall, and the retroperitoneal soft tissues.  This tumor is well-encapsulated containing fetal-embryonal fat and loose fibrovascular connective tissue. The lipoblastoma arising from chest wall is rare and frequently has extrathoracic component [2, 3]. 

     The tumor presents in two forms: a circumscribed lesion which is situated superficially (lipoblastoma) and a less common diffuse form which arises in deeper tissue (lipoblastomatosis) [1].      Histologically, the differentiation of lipoblastoma from liposarcoma, especially its myxoid variant, may be difficult.  However, these benign immature adipocytic neoplasms have a more uniform growth pattern and typically show more striking lobulation.
     Although lipoblasts in different stages of maturation are present in lipoblastoma, there is no nuclear atypia or pleomorphism, in contrast to that seen, at least focally, in liposarcoma [1].
     In the younger patients, when they arises from the neck or mediastinum, these tumors can grow rapidly leading to recurrent respiratory infection or asphyxia, occasionally causing death if not removed [4]. 

     Radiographically, lipoblastoma presents as a non-specific soft-tissue density mass.
     CT allows identification of the fatty component and prominent intratumoral stranding, but may not allow differentiation between the various adipose tumors [3].
     A case of lipoblastoma which was hypointense to fat on T1-weighted images and was of high signal intensity on T2-weighted image has also been described.  This atypical MR manifestation was ascribed to the presence of an excessive amount of immature fat and myxoid tissue, intratumoral infarction, and extensive mucoid and cystic degeneration [2].
     In the current case, MRI demonstrated a mass with areas of high signal intensity which was slightly lower than that of the subcutaneous fat on T-1 weighted image.  Moreover, MRI suggested the chest wall origin of the tumor which was important for preoperative planning by the visualization of the tumor separating pleural effusion and intratumoral streaks and whorls radially arranged from the chest wall side of the tumor.  This area of low signal intensity was corresponded well with the area of contrast enhancement on CT scan and the fibrovascular connective tissue on pathologic examination. 

     The main differential diagnosis is from a liposarcoma which may have an identical clinical and radiological presentation but is extremely rare in patients under 10 years of age [1].  Local recurrence following surgical excision of lipoblastoma is uncommon.  Metastases have not been reported [4]. 

     In current case, a large size of the tumor was notable at the age of 4 months, suggesting that it grew rapidly compressing the lung which caused severe respiratory distress.  Additionally respiratory distress might have been attributed to pleural effusion associated with rupture of the tumor.  Pleural effusion is an ancillary finding of ruptured teratoma [5].  Choi et al. described that pleural effusion was associated in 57% of the cases in ruptured teratoma [5].  We assumed that the pleural effusion in current case resulted from either spillage of internal components of a mass or from an inflammatory reaction to the extravasated contents.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-79-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-79-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-79-3.jpg']",15,"['correct:2/15', 'semi:3/15']"

","    Lymphangiomas are rare benign lesions of lymphatic origin, representing 0.7-4.5% of all mediastinal tumors and occurring most commonly in the superior or anterior mediastinum. Lymphangiomas are most common in the neck and axilla. Although 10% of cervical lymphangiomas extend into mediastinum, less than 5% of lymphangiomas are limited to the mediastinum itself. The origin of lymphangiomas is controversial; they may be developmental, hamartomatous, or neoplastic. But as with hemangiomas, lymphangiomas probably represent developmental anomalies rather than true neoplasms. 
     Because of their soft consistency, lymphangiomas seldom cause symptoms, even when large, occasionally, however, they cause symptoms by compressing the tracheobronchial tree, or the superior vena cava or its major tributaries. In younger patients particularly, a soft tissue mass may be visible in the neck. Chylothorax develops in some cases.
     Most lymphangiomas are present at birth and are detected in the first 2 years of life, but they can be seen in adults as well. In adults, it is common for a lymphangioma to be localized in the mediastinum.
     Lymphangiomas are classified into three groups, depending on the size of the lymphatic channels: 1) capillary lymphangiomas, 2) cavernous lymphangiomas, 3) cystic lymphangiomas. Histologically, lymphangiomas are thin-walled, cystic, multilocular tumors, lined by endothelial cells and containing clear yellow fluid. Their wall consists of connective tissue, smooth muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerve, or lymphatic tissue. 
     On plain radiographs, lymphangiomas form well-defined, round, lobulated masses, usually in the anterior or superior mediasitnum. Most mediastinal lymphangiomas appear homogeneous and cystic on CT, but some appear inhomogeneous because of the presence of protein, fluid, blood, or fat in the lesion. Although minimal enhancement cannot be excluded in the lesions showing inhomogeneous attenuation, enhancement is not apparent after intravenous infusion of contrast medium. Although most lymphangiomas are multiloculated on histologic examination, CT demonstration of delicate septa is rare. Most lymphangiomas have thin walls, but cases with thicker walls have been reported. Calcification in the lesion is very rare. Displacement or compression of the surrounding mediastinal structures is absent or minimal in most mediastinal lymphangiomas despite their large size.

This unusual form of pulmonary aspergillosis resembles clinically a number of other chronic pulmonary diseases including tuberculosis, actinomycosis, histoplasmosis (1). 

The patients are usually middle-aged and have poor nutrition due to alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, chronic granulomatous disease or connective tissue disorders. Pulmonary abnormalities resulting in lowered defense mechanisms of the lung such as fibrotic area of mycobacterial infection, chronic obstructive lung disease, previous surgery, radiation therapy, pulmonary infarction or pneumoconiosis may be associated (2). 

Clinical symptoms include cough, sputum, fever, weight loss, and hemoptysis, usually persisting at least for a few months. This time course is different from that of invasive aspergillosis (IPA) in which the rate of progression depends on the degree of immunosuppression of host (usually two or three weeks). 

Gefter et al (3) reviewed radiographic findings of semi-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in five patients. They appeared as consolidation or progressing cystic infiltrate subsequently forming a thick-walled cavity and aspergilloma with upper lobe predominance. And pleural thickening was frequently seen.

According to Kim et al (4) in a review of six cases of semi-invasive aspergillosis, the CT findings of the disease were diverse ranging from findings of bronchopneumonia to cavitary consolidation containing an aspergilloma. Main feature distinguishing chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis from aspergilloma is the presence of obvious tissue invasion and destruction in the former. Whereas, pulmonary aspergilloma usually forms within preexisting cavity without tissue invasion. Pathologically, the findings of angioinvasion are lacking which are characteristic in IPA. 

Treatment option depends on the clinical status of the patients; from observation in asymptomatic patients to antifungal therapy or surgical resection in patients with hemoptysis or progressing disease.",['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-310-1.jpg'],21,"['correct:12/21', 'semi:5/21']"

During the course of the illness, 90% of patients have lung involvement. Other involved sites include upper respiratory tract such as paranasal sinus and kidney. 
Most characteristic pulmonary radiological finding is nodular masses (60%) or consolidation (30%), either of which may cavitate (40%). Nodules are usually 2 to 4 cm in diameter and less than 10 in number. They have no specific predilection site and may have necrotic centers.

A combination of cytotoxic and corticosteroid therapy has dramatically improved the long-term survival of patients with Wegener granulomatosis. With extended survival, patients now experience diverse cardiopulmonary abnormalities that represent primary or secondary manifestations of the disease or that result from diagnosis and treatment. 
Aberle et al [3] reviewed the medical histories and chest radiologic findings of 19 patients with the histologic diagnosis of Wegener granulomatosis.

  ABPA occurs almost exclusively in asthmatic patients. 
  Pathologically, the central bronchi are distended with thick mucus, admixed with cellular debris and eosinophils. The bronchial wall shows inflammatory cell infiltrate without evidence of fungal invasion. An eosinophilic pneumonia may be seen in the surrounding lung parenchyma (1).

  Patients have symptoms including wheezing, fever, cough, pleuritic pain, and expectoration of typical mucus plugs. 
  On thin-section CT, the presence of proximal saccular bronchiectasis is considered virtually pathognomonic for ABPA.

 CT scans show an anterior mediastinal mass with relatively homogeneous attenuation.
 The serum tumor markers (AFP, HCG) were not elevated.","Seminoma is the next most frequent (25-40%) mediastinal germ cell tumor after teratoma and occurs almost exclusively in men (90%), whose average age at presentation is about 30 years. 

 Pathologically, the tumor is composed of nests of clear or vacuolated cells separated by a variably thick fibrovascular stroma containing numerous lymphocytes. This pathologic findings are same as testicular seminoma, ovarian dysgerminoma or germinoma.


 Approximately 30 % of patients are asymptomatic at the time of initial diagnosis. When present, symptoms are usually derived from pressure or invasion of vascular structures within mediastinum. The serum tumor markers (AFP, HCG) are not elevated.

 Radiographically, seminomas usually appear as a lobulated non-calcified mass that cannot be distinguished from other malignant germ cell tumors. CT shows mildly enhancing homogeneous soft tissue mass with a few areas of low attenuation. The adjacent mediastinal fat planes may be obliterated and extensive local invasion may be identified. Also superior vena caval obstruction is not uncommon. The differential diagnosis includes lymphoma of the thymus, metastatic carcinoma, and other primary malignant tumors arising in the anterior mediastinum.

 Non-seminomatous malignant germ cell tumors, namely the endodermal sinus tumors (EST), choriocarcinomas, and embryonal carcinomas, are not only more aggressive lesions than their seminomatous counterparts, but they are also more aggressive when compared with their identical histologic testicular counterparts. Great majority of patients with malignant germ cell tumors are symptomatic; cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and not uncommonly superior vena caval (SVC) syndrome.

 ESTs, the rarest of the germ cell tumors, secret alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and tumor activity is strongly correlated with the serum level. Human chorionic gonadotropin is detectable in some cases of EST; however, it is generally accepted that this endocrinopathy is due to small foci of choriocarcinoma or embryonal carcinoma within the EST. 

 CT has been useful in differentiating between the non-seminomatous and seminomatous germ cell tumors. Seminomas have been described as large, sharply demarcated masses that are usually of homogeneous attenuation. Chest wall invasion is rare, as is the development of pleuropericardial effusion.


 In contrast, non-seminomatous tumors are of heterogeneous attenuation. The areas of lower attenuation within the tumors are due to necrosis and hemorrhage. A strong tendency for bony invasion and fat plane obliteration exists. Thick capsules that enhance after IV administration of contrast material have been described. Rarely coarse tumor calcification may be evident. Pleural effusion are more common.

 Although CT may be helpful in differentiating between the two subtypes of germ cell tumors, its use in differentiating germ cell tumor from other tumors of the anterior mediastinum is more questionable. Thymomas, carcinoid tumors, lymphoma, and mediastinal metastases must also be considered in the differential diagnosis of heterogeneous anterior mediastinal masses.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-345-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-345-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-345-3.jpg']",18,"['correct:5/18', 'semi:3/18']"

Pathologic specimen consisted of an encapsulated soft tissue mass, measuring 9 x 5 cm in size. 
On section, it showed a relatively well-defined yellowish and ovoid infarcted area in the central portion, associated with small multiple nodular lesions in the peripheral area.","The term ""invasive thymoma"" is a description of any tumor that has spread beyond the capsule. Approximately 30 % of thymomas are invasive, which infiltrate adjacent structures or result in pleural or pericardial implants. Until mediastinal invasion has occurred, distinguishing benign from invasive thymoma even with CT is not possible.
 Histologic appearances do not allow a reliable differentiation between benign and malignant thymoma; malignancy can only be established by documenting the presence of tumor growth into or through the tumor capsule. Thus, thymomas are most appropriately referred as invasive or noninvasive. 
 This neoplasm grows (a) to invade local mediastinal structures, including the superior vena cava, great vessels, and even the airways; (b) to invade the adjacent lungs or chest wall; or (c) to spread by contiguity along pleural reflections, usually on one side of the chest cavity only, potentially seeding even the diaphragmatic surfaces with consequent direct extension into the abdomen. 
 Transpleural spread may occur as a sheet of neoplastic tissue extending outward from the primary thymic tumor, or it may manifest as a discrete ""drop metastasis"" at a distance from the primary lesion. Pleural implants, when present, are often unilateral, and unlike other tumors resulting in pleural metastases, are usually unassociated with pleural effusion. Thus, CT cans show focal, well-defined pleural masses, not obscured by pleural fluid. 
 Invasive thymomas growing along pleural surfaces can reach the posterior mediastinum and extend downward along the aorta to involve the crus of the diaphragm and the retroperitoneum. Blood-borne metastasis is rare.
 There are three stages for invasive thymomas; stage 1, in which the capsule is either intact, or the tumor has not spread beyond the capsule; stage 2, in which the tumor has spread into the mediastinal fat; stage 3, in which there is invasion of adjacent organs or pleural spread at a distance from the primary tumor.

Right sided mediastinal lymph nodes are more commonly involved because the preferential lymph flow of entire right lung and left upper lung to right tracheobronchial and paratracheal nodes as well as the higher frequency of right lung pulmonary tuberculosis involvement. The involved lymph nodes show necrotic central low attenuation area and enhanced peripheral portion due to inflammatory hypervasculaity on enhanced CT scan. 

 Esophageal involvement by tuberculosis usually occurs in the late stages of tuberculosis secondary to pulmonary, mediastinal, or disseminated disease. Direct contiguous involvement from adjacent tuberculous lymphadenitis is known to be the most frequent cause of esophageal tuberculosis. On contrast enhanced CT, these lymph nodes typically show central low density with peripheral rim enhancement representing caseation necrosis and hyperemic granulation tissue, respectively. Necrotic material within the tuberculous mediastinal lymph node can be extruded through an esophageal and/or tracheobroncheal fistula, resulting in a localized gaseous collection within the mediastinum. Even though tuberculous lymphadenitis involves right paratracheal nodes more commonly than subcarinal nodes, as the diseased right paratracheal nodes have less chance to contact the esophagus than the subcarinal nodes, fistulous communication is more prone to occur in the subcarinal area.

Contrast-enhanced CT scans demonstrate moderately enhancing mass, which is continuous with the lower pole of left thyroid gland. 
Left innominate vein is swept downward by the mediastinal mass. ","Goiters in the superior mediastinum arise from one or both lower poles of the thyroid gland or from the isthmus. With growth of the goiter, aided by deglutition, gravity, and negative intrathoracic pressure, the goiter enters the thorax, generally taking its cervical blood supply with it. 

Intrathoracic goiters can be classified primary and secondary. The presence of vascular stalks with cervical thyroid gland makes intrathoracic goiter secondary, while absence of them makes it primary (or ectopic). Primary intrathoracic goiters are very rare, with a reported incidence of 0.2 to 1 per cent of all goiters. 


Although clear continuity between the cervical and intrathoracic components should be present in cases of mediastinal goiter extension, the connection may only be a narrow fibrous or vascular pedicle. In such cases, as well as in the presence of a primary intrathoracic goiter, lack of continuity between the cervical gland and the thoracic mass does not exclude goiter as the diagnosis. 


Pathologically the nontoxic nodular goiter has distended follicles with colloid and hyperplasia of the thyroid tissue. The follicles can rupture with resultant inflammatory changes, and ultimate degeneration can occur with hemorrhage, infarction, fibrosis, cyst formation, and calcification. 

Normal thyroid tissue has higher attenuation values than soft tissue because of its high iodine content and shows intense postcontrast enhancement. The high attenuation of an intrathoracic goiter may depend on the density of iodine per unit volume and the extent of degeneration. 

The typical CT features of intrathoracic goiter can be summarized as follows: 
1. continuity with the cervical thyroid gland, 
2. well-defined borders, 
3. punctate, coarse, or ringlike calcifications, 
4. nonhomogeneity often with minimal or nonenhancing, well defined, low-density areas,

Tc-99m MAA perfusion scan (below) reveals tracer uptake in the brain, thyroid, kidneys, stomach, and soft tissue as well as both lungs, which means right-to-left shunt (shunt fraction= 29%, normal=<10%). ","  Hepatopulmonary syndrome represents a combination of hypoxemia, hepatic dysfunction, and intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. 

  This is one of the main causes of arterial hypoxemia in patients with chronic liver disease.
  Although the pathogenesis of vascular dilatation is unknown, some investigators have suggested that failure of the damaged liver to clear circulating vasodilators and inhibition of a circulating vasoconstrictive substance by the damaged liver. 

 Arterial hypoxemia in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome is thought to occur because of ventilation-perfusion mismatch, limitations in oxygen diffusion due to vascular dilatation, 
and in some patients, intrapulmonary shunt through dilated vascular malformations. 

  The radiologic manifestations of this disease include distal vascular dilatation associated with an abnormally large number of visible terminal vessel branches, which are always concentrated in the lower lung zones.

  Lee et al. reported that the peripheral pulmonary vessels in the patients with hypoxemic liver cirrhosis were significantly dilated compared with these vessels in the healthy subjects and patients with cirrhosis who were not hypoxemic.

  Tc-99m MAA lung scan is a useful method to detect intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. 
  Because the average capillary diameter is approximately 7 μm, the MAA particles, 
  90 % of which measure 10 to 90 μm, lodge in the first capillary bed they encounter.
  A scan showing uptake of radionuclide over the kidneys, brain, or both suggests shunting through the lung caused by an intrapulmonary shunt.

HRCT scans show multifocal, patchy areas of consolidation, ground-glass attenuation, irregular linear opacities in both lungs.

On lower scan (not shown here), the liver showed slightly higher attenuation than usual.

The patient has been treated with amiodarone because of atrial fibrillation.

Pathologic specimen obtained from right lower lobe by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) showed 
diffuse intraalveolar fibroblastic proliferation, diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes in alveolar wall and intraalveolar fibroblastic tissue. 
The histologic findings were compatible with amiodarone-induced chronic interstitial pneumonia and BOOP pattern."," In this case, amiodarone was discontinued and successive chest radiographs showed progressive resolution of previously noted parenchymal consolidation with improvement of symptoms.

 Amiodarone is a triiodinated drug used to treat refractory tachyarrhythmia (1). 
 The drug usually accumulates in the liver and in the lung, where its half-life is extremely long (25-60 days). 
 The reported prevalence of pulmonary toxicity in the patients receiving amiodarone ranges from 1.4 % to 18 % (2-4). 

 Clinical indications of amiodarone toxicity range from acute onset of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath to more indolent symptoms of malaise, fever, cough, and dyspnea. 

 Conventional radiographic findings are area of consolidation, infiltration, or interstitial disease, findings that are entirely nonspecific and easily confused with pulmonary abnormalities caused by congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary infarction (4-6). 

 Gallium imaging has been used to detect amiodarone toxicity, but although very sensitive to inflammation, gallium imaging is not disease- or drug-specific (7).


 CT findings indicative of significant amiodarone exposure include high-attenuation parenchymal/pleural lesion, and increased liver and/or spleen attenuation (4, 8). 

 CT findings of high-attenuation parenchymal/pleural abnormalities are thought to be related to the iodinated chemistry of the drug and its prolonged half-life within the lung.

 Therapy involves discontinuing amiodarone therapy whenever possible and administrating corticosteroids. 
 At times, life-threatening arrhythmia can be stabilized only with amiodarone. 
 Thus, a compromise between lower amiodarone doses and short-term or long-term corticosteroid therapy must be made (9).","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-231-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-231-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-231-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-231-4.jpg']",47,['correct:47/47']

The margin at the junction of the mass with the pleura tapers smoothly. Two differential diagnoses include localized fibrous tumor of the pleura and loculated pleural effusion (""phantom tumor""). However, contrast-enhanced CT scans show mild enhancement of the mass, favoring the possibility of localized fibrous tumor of the pleura.","  The term ""localized benign (or malignant) fibrous tumor of the pleura (LFTP)"" is preferred because histologically these tumors do not contain epithelial cells but derive from a submesothelial mesenchymal cell with fibroblastic differentiation. Localized fibrous tumor of the pleura is rare tumor of mesodermal origin representing less than 5% of all neoplasia involving the pleura. The tumors are discovered incidentally on routine chest radiography, and there is no sex predilection and no evidence of a relationship in asbestos exposure. 
   Approximately 70 to 80% of these tumors arise from visceral pleura, with the remainder arising from the parietal pleura. A small number are intrapulmonary in location. Most are pedunculated. Large areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are more suggestive of malignant behavior. In Briselli and colleague's review, the best predictor of a good prognosis was the presence of pedicle. Clinically, LFTP occurs in both sexes and in all age groups but predominantly affects persons more than 50 years. 
   Approximately 50% of patients are asymptomatic, and 40% of symptomatic patients complain chest pain, cough and dyspnea. Extrathoracic manifestations include hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in 4 - 35% and hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia, noted in less than 5% of patients, is usually associated with very large tumor and is thought to be due to glucose consumption by the mass. 
   Radiologically, a small to medium-sized tumor appears as a solitary, sharply delineated, often lobulated nodule or mass of variable size from 1 to 39 cm, and forms obtuse angle with the chest wall. Large tumors can appear as opacification of a portion of one hemithorax, and often forms acute angle with the chest wall as the mass is pedunculated or becomes larger than the pleural origin. LFTP exist in the costal compartment of pleura, within an interlobar fissure, along pleural surface of mediastinum, along the diaphragmatic pleura and rarely within the lung parenchyma. These tumors predominate in the middle and lower half of the chest. A pedunculated LFTP can change position and appearance with respiration or with a change in position. Calcification has been reported in 7% of tumors. Pleural effusion was present in 8 - 17 % of cases but is more likely to be associated with malignant tumors than the benign.
   On CT scans, LFTPs are well-delineated, often lobulated soft-tissue attenuation mass in close relation to the pleural surface or fissure, and absence of chest wall invasion. The margin at the junction of the mass with the pleura usually tapers smoothly. Calcifications are noted in large tumors and related to the areas of necrosis. The tumors have rich vascularization and shows intense and homogeneous enhancement. Non-enhancing areas on CT scans correspond to necrosis, myxoid degeneration, or hemorrhage within the tumor. Identification of pedicle is a clue to the diagnosis. CT findings that suggest a malignant fibrous tumor include a diameter larger than 10 cm, central necrosis, and ipsilateral pleural effusion.

  ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus species, commonly found fungi in soil. It occurs almost exclusively in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. The disease is the result of immunologic response to the endoluminal growth of species.
  The diagnosis of ABPA is based on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic criteria. Primary criteria include asthma, radiologic evidence of pulmonary infiltration, positive skin test to A. fumigatus, eosinophilia, precipitating Ab to A. fumigatus, elevated IgE, elevated A. fumigatus-specific IgE and IgG, and central bronchiectasis. A diagnosis of ABPA is nearly certain when six of these eight criteria are fulfilled. But, many of these findings are nonspecific. Only central bronchiectasis is nearly pathognomomic and essential to diagnosis to most cases. The symptoms include cough, hemoptysis, fever, pleuritic pain, wheezing, and dyspnea.
   In patients with ABPA, bronchiectasis is a sequel to mucoid impaction of central airway. Aspergillus proliferates in proximal bronchi, acting as an Ag stimulus for production of IgE and IgG Ab. Then the inflammatory reaction results in mucosal irritation, and eventually, damage to bronchial wall. Pathologically, central bronchi are distended with thick mucus, admixed with cellular debris and eosinophils. The bronchial wall shows inflammatory cell infiltrate without evidence of fungal invasion.
  The characteristic radiologic findings are result of dilated bronchi with or without mucoid impaction and air-fluid levels; homogeneous, finger-like densities in a precise bronchial distribution, usually involves upper lobes and segmental or subsegmental bronchi. These opacities are described variably, such as ""gloved-finger"", ""inverted Y or V"", or ""cluster of grapes"" appearance. The CT often shows varicose or cystic mucoid impaction within the bronchi. ABPA, a hypersensitivity reaction in which organisms remain within airway lumen, should be differentiated from invasive aspergillosis, defined as angioinvasive and airway-invasive in immunocompromised patients.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-232-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-232-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-232-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-232-4.jpg']",56,['correct:48/56']

In the thorax, the sympathetic chains are most commonly involved, but plexiform neurofibromas of the vagus and phrenic nerves are rare (5).
 Plexiform neurofibromas appear as a diffuse fusiform enlargement of the peripheral nerves and /or as multiple masses along the course of the peripheral nerves (4).

No significantly enlarged arterial feeder originating from the descending thoracic aorta was seen on enhanced CT scan or during the surgery.

Pathologic Note: This cyst has a structure of bronchioles and alveoli in addition to bronchus structure. These histologic findings are not compatible with bronchogenic cyst and the possibility of sequestration is most likely considered.","Pulmonary sequestration is an uncommon congenital anomaly encountered in approximately 1.1-1.8 % of all pulmonary resections (1-2). Theses lesions consist of maldeveloped lung tissue that lacks a normal connection to the tracheobronchial tree (and is therefore typically separate from normal lung) and derives its blood supply from systemic vessels. Classically, it has been described in two forms: (1) intralobar sequestration, in which the sequestered part of the lung lies within normal pulmonary visceral pleura, and (2) extralobar sequestration, in which the abnormal segment of the lung is completely separate and enclosed in its own pleural investment. The arterial supply is systemic and venous return is either by a pulmonary vein (in the intralobar form) or by a systemic vein (in the extralobar form) (1, 3). Pulmonary sequestration is generally thought to be congenital (4), although some authors have argued that intralobar sequestrations may be acquired (1, 5).

 Extralobar sequestration accounts for 25 % of all classic pulmonary sequestrations (5). A majority of cases (61 %) occur in the first 6 months of life, often presenting in the first day of life with dyspnea, cyanosis, and feeding difficulties. Extralobar sequestration is typically in the lower hemithorax (3, 4). The typical location is within the pleural space in the posterior costodiaphragmatic sulcus between in the diaphragm and the lower lobes (63-77 %) of cases (1, 5). However, it can also occur in the mediastinum, within the diaphragm, and, rarely, below the diaphragm (1). It has an even greater left-side preponderance (over 80 %) (1, 3, 4). Whereas, intralobar sequestration is almost always located posterobasally in the lower lobe, with a left-side preponderance (58 %) (3, 6). The demonstration of a systemic arterial supply to the lesion is the critical diagnostic feature of extralobar sequestration. The anomalous artery or arteries typically arise from the thoracic aorta (less often from the abdominal aorta) in approximately 80 % of cases and enter the lung via the pulmonary ligament (1, 3, 5). In 15 % of cases, the lesions are supplied by smaller arteries such as splenic, gastric, subclavian, or intercostal arteries. Branches of the pulmonary artery supply the lesions in 5 % of cases. The venous drainage is usually systemic (80%), through the azygos and hemiazygos system, or the vena cava to the right atrium. In about 25 % of the lesions are drained through the pulmonary veins (1, 5).

 Radiographically, extralobar sequestration manifests as a single, well-defined, homogenous, triangular opacity typically located in the lower thorax in close association with the posterior medial hemidiaphragm. The lesion may manifest as a mass elsewhere in the thoracic cavity, including the upper thorax, the mediastinum, and the paravertebral region (1). Other findings include normal-appearing lung, hyperlucent areas, and combination of solid and cystic masses and pneumonia (3. 7). CT of the chest characteristically demonstrates extralobar sequestration as a homogenous, well-circumscribed mass of soft-tissue attenuation (1). Emphysematous changes of the adjacent nonsequestered lung have been described. CT may demonstrate cystic areas within the extralobar sequestration (1, 3). The anomalous systemic artery is visualized less frequently (1).

 Ikezoe et al (3) reported the CT findings of the pulmonary sequestration with 24 cases. They classified lung abnormalities shown by CT into three types: A= cysts containing air or fluid or soft tissue masses; B= emphysematous lung surrounding cysts, and/or soft tissue nodules; and C= lung hypervascularity. Among the eight extralobar sequestrations in their study, all but one extralobar sequestration had pulmonary cysts (n=1) or emphysema (n=6) in the lung tissue immediately adjacent to the sequestration (type B). In these patients, four had mediastinal cystic masses. In their study, supplying arteries could be demonstrated at CT in 16 of 24 sequestrations including intra- and extralobar types.

 The treatment of symptomatic or large asymptomatic sequestrations is surgical resection. Extralobar sequestrations with their separate pleural investments can usually be removed sparing normal lung, tissue, although in intralobar type, segmental resection or even lobectomy will be necessary (1, 2).","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-410-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-410-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-410-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-410-4.jpg']",40,['correct:28/40']

It appears that pulmonary Kaposis sarcoma is rare in the absence of cutaneous involvement. Another clinical pointer is the occurrence of hemoptysis.

Chest CT scans show multiple nodules and consolidations with or without a halo of ground-glass attenuation in the both peripheral lungs. CT-angiogram sign is seen in the consolidations of both lower lobes.","Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma can be defined as a peripheral, well-differentiated neoplasm, with a tendency to spread locally in the peripheral air space, using the lung structure as stroma. 

Three types of this primary carcinoma of the lung have been recognized: a solitary nodule(43%), consolidation(30%), and multicentric or diffuse disease(27%). 

A characteristic finding of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma is presence of bubble-like lucencies and pseudocavitation, which corresponds to patent small bronchi or air-containing cystic spaces in papillary tumors. 

Mucin is of lower radiographic density than tumor, so it creates the areas of lower attenuation on mediastinal windows. The low attenuation allows vessels to be clearly seen, particularly after administration of IV contrast material. This finding, described as the CT angiogram sign, is suggestive but not specific for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. 

Multicentric or diffuse bronchioloalveolar carcinoma could be classified into three patterns: predominantly ground-glass, consolidative, and multinodular. Most patients with diffuse bronchioloalveolar carcinoma had a mixture of these findings.

Contrast-enhanced CT scans show a little-enhancing, low attenuation mass in left paraspinal region. 
On surgery, a well-defined cystic mass was found in the posterior mediastinum.","Bronchogenic cysts are congenital lesions resulting from abnormalities in ventral budding or branching of the bronchopulmonary foregut. 

The lesions have been classified as mediastinal and intrapulmonary types. 

Mediastinal cysts are far more frequent and do not communicate with the bronchial tree, unlike intraparenchymal cysts in which such communications usually develop, leading to frequent recurrent infection. 

Most bronchogenic cysts are most commonly located in the carinal area (52%), followed by paratracheal area (19%), esophageal wall (14%), and retrocardiac area (9%).  

These cysts rarely can be seen in other locations such as the anterior mediastinum, the low posterior mediastinum, or in the lung itself. 

Their classic chest radiographic findings are clearly defined round or oval masses of water density, commonly located just inferior to the carina. 

These thin-walled cysts are lined with respiratory epithelium and cyst fluid is composed primarily of water admixed with varying amounts of thick proteinaceous mucus. Calcium oxalate crystals have also been detected in the fluid. 

This variable fluid composition explains the different CT attenuations observed in bronchogenic cysts. 

Usually, CT of bronchogenic cyst shows a mass with the same attenuation as that of water, reflecting their serous nature. 

However, in one-half of all bronchogenic cysts, the CT density can vary from a low soft-tissue range to higher-than-muscle density, likely due to intracystic hemorrhage, protein, or calcium.


Those patients who are asymptomatic and have small cysts with typical CT findings can be followed.

A 70-year-old man presented with chest discomfort, cough, dyspnea, fever and chill for 30 days.  He had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. Physical examination revealed asymmetric expansion of thoracic cage and decreased breathing sound in left lower lung zone. Laboratory findings revealed elevated WBC count, and negative for AFB staining. Bronchoscopic examination revealed a protruding mass in the left lower lobar bronchus covered with necrotic materials. Transbronchial and percutaneous needle biopsy were performed in left lower lobar mass and a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer was made.  

Frontal chest radiograph shows prominent left hilum, and a large increased density in left lower lung zone with volume decrease without obliteration of left cardiac border. Left lateral chest radiograph shows consolidation of left lower lobe with mild volume decrease. Contrast-enhanced chest CT scans show 1cm sized low-density mass in left lower lobar bronchus and consolidations of left lower lobe with mucus-bronchogram. These findings suggest endogenous lipoid pneumonia of left lower lobe due to endobronchial mass.","Endogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP), which is also called as postobstructive pneumonitis occurs distal to major airway obstruction. ELP results from a variety of causes including neoplasm and infection. Pathologically it is a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucous plugging, and parenchymal inflammation and fibrosis. The lobes often have yellowish or golden hue, which is thought to be produced by the liberation of lipid material from alveolar pneumocytes secondary to the inflammatory reaction. This appearance has given rise to the term golden pneumonia; this abnormality is also known as cholesterol pneumonia. In the vast majority of the cases the inflammation is not caused by bacterial infection. In involved parenchyma that has been recently obstructed, the principal histologic finding is filling of alveolar air space by proteinaceous fluid containing scattered macrophages and cultures are usually sterile. In later stages fluid is replaced by macrophages containing foamy and vacuolated cytoplasm, which is different from the large vacuoles in exogenous lipoid pneumonia. Etiologies of ELP include malignant neoplasms, such as bronchogenic squamous or small cell carcinoma, carcinoid, mucoepidermoid carcinoma; metastatic carcinoma from kidney, colorectum, breast or melanoma; benign rare bronchial tumors such as endobronchial hamartoma, lipoma or schwanoma; other occluding lesions such as mucus plug, foreign body or bronchial fracture; infection such as endobronchial tuberculosis, endobronchial actinomycosis; inflammatory lesions such as antracofibrosis or broncholithiasis; or middle lobe syndrome. 

This case was due to small cell lung cancer. Small cell carcinoma is typically located in relation to proximal airways, particularly lobar and main bronchi. Centrally located tumors tend to spread in the submucosa and peribronchovascular connective tissue, and then extend into adjacent lung parenchyma to become a more circumscribed mass that obliterates underlying airways and vessels. Endobronchial growth is seen much less frequently than in squamous cell carcinoma; in fact when airway obstruction occurs, it is usually as a result of compression by the expanding tumor rather than intraluminal growth. CT can better depict the extent of the mass as well as the nature of it.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-85-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-85-2.jpg']",55,['correct:45/55']

CT scan at the level of cardiac ventricle demonstrates multicystic mass in left lower lobe with consolidation.,"CCAM occurs as adenomatous overgrowth of the terminal bronchioles, with subsequent suppression of alveolar growth. These lesions have intracystic communications and, unlike bronchogenic cysts, a connection to the tracheobronchial tree.
Stocker subclassified cystic adenomatoid malformations into three different types.

Type I malformation occurs as multiple large cysts (>2 cm in diameter), or as a single, large dominant cyst surrounded by numerous smaller cysts. Type I malformations are the most common form, accounting for up to 50% of cases. 

Type II malformation makes up 42% of cases. These are described as multiple, evenly spaced cysts, mostly less than 2cm in diameter. 

Type III malformation accounts for approximately 3% of the total. They are described as bulky microcystic lesions.

CCAM affects all lobes equally, and there is no right or left predominance.
Chest radiographic findings are variable and depend on the type of cyst present. Multiple air filled cysts are usually seen on the PA film. There is a depression of the ipsilateral diaphragm and a contralateral mediastinal shift. CCAM may change rapidly in size. Mucus retention or recurrent infection may lead to a granular or inhomogeneous appearance. The characteristic CT appearance consists of a localized complex cystic lesion and in the adult can be difficult to distinguish from sequestration.

Contrast enhanced CT scans show an anomalous vein that courses downward along the left lateral aspect of the aortic arch, curves into AP window, and crosses the midline between the trachea and the ascending aorta. It enters the superior vena cava at the level of azygos arch. The normal left brachiocephalic vein is not seen in its normal position, and the prevascular space is occupied by the aortic arch and great arteries. The right main pulmonary artery is noted inferior to the above-mentioned vessel. ","The incidence among patients with congenital heart disease is from 0.015-0.2% by autopsy to 0.98% by ultrasonography. In previous reports ALBCV has  been said to be commonly associated with congenital heart disease. This is because radiological evaluation has been usually given only to patients with cardiovascular disease. In recent reports, ALBCV frequently exists by itself, without other congenital heart diseases. 
In the 8th week of fetal development, the precardinal anastomosis appears between both precardinal veins, after which the left cardinal vein disappears. Therefore, the blood flow from the left head and neck regions is carried mainly via precardinal anastomosis into the proximal right precardinal vein. This anastomosis develops into the left brachiocephalic vein. Anomalous left brachiocephalic vein (ALBCV) is thought to be the precardinal anastomosis situated posterior to trunk arteriosus (ventral aorta).
The exact pathogenesis of this anomaly is unknown. There are several hypotheses. One speculated that, in addition to a left brachiocephalic vein, some minor interconnections might exist in the mediastinum between the paired precardinal veins during fetal development. Others suggested that ALBCV is secondarily formed when the aortic arch remains high in the mediastinum in the 8th embryonic week and obstructs the normal pathway of the ventral anastomotic vein. In addition to high aortic arch, abnormal elongation of the aorta, which results in narrowing of the prevascular space and widening of the subaortic space, increase the chance for the development of precardinal anastomosis posterior to the aortic sac. 
ALBCV must be distinguished from other major vessels especially in a preoperative examination. An atrophic right pulmonary artery and a high positioned pulmonary artery may be similar to the crossing part of the ALBCV, and the descending portion of the ALBCV must be differentiated from the persistent left SVC. One should confirm each vascular courses and junctions by CT or MR. Recognition of this venous anomaly before cardiac catheterization or cardiovascular surgery is important because the ALBCV passes adjacent to the pulmonary artery and ductus arteriosus.

The serous pericardium can be divided into a visceral layer, or epicardium, which covers the heart and great vessels, and a parietal layer, which lines the fibrous pericardium. The visceral pericardium is reflected from the heart, along the great vessels, and onto the parietal pericardium. At these reflections and between the great vessels, recesses or sinuses are formed within the pericardial space. These include the superior pericardial recess, transverse and oblique sinuses, the left pulmonic recess, the pulmonary venous recesses, and the recesses around the superior and inferior vena cavae. 
Under physiologic conditions, pericardial cavity contains 20-25mL of serous fluid; however, the amount of fluid may vary considerably among individuals, particularly in children and infants. These differences may explain, at least in part, why in some patients, sinuses or recesses may or may not be seen.

There are several nodules in RML & lingular segment, showing pseudocavitations (bubblelike areas of low attenuation).","Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis (PLC) occurs commonly in patients with metastatic adenocarcinomas from the breast, lung, stomach, colon, pancreas, or cervix. PLC usually results from hematogenous spread to lung, with subsequent interstitial and lymphatic invasion, but can also occur because of direct lymphatic spread of tumor from mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Tumor growth in the lymphatics in peribronchovascular interstitium, interlobular septa and subpleural regions, and associated edema, result in characteristic HRCT findings of smooth or nodular interstitial thickenings with preservation of normal lung architecture. Diseases showing smooth (pulmonary edema) or nodular interstitial thickenings (sarcoidosis or silicosis) should be included in differential diagnosis.
 Calcified mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are most frequently identified in patients with granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis or histoplasmosis. In this entity, lymph nodes are usually diffusely calcified. Calcified lymph nodes may also be seen in patients with sarcoidosis, silicosis or coal worker's pneumoconiosis, Hodgkin's disease following preceding radiation, amyloidosis, scleroderma, Castleman's disease and in AIDS patients with pneumocystis carinii infection. Rarely, calcification may occur within nodes as a result of metastatic disease, typically from the colon. 
 Pseudocavitation (bubblelike areas of low attenuation within a nodule) is one of characteristic findings of nodular form of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC), a subtype of adenocarcinoma. Diagnosis of BAC can be made in patients who do not have other bronchogenic adenocarcinoma nor adenocarcinoma involving another organ, because metastatic adenocarcinoma from colon, pancreas, or biliary tract with growth along the alveolar septa may mimic BAC histologically.

None of the thymic carcinoma that has been reported was associated with myasthenia gravis or other systemic manifestations, which usually may be associated with thymoma. 

Thymic carcinoma can grow locally to invade surrounding mediastinal structures. 
The tumor can dissect along the outer aspect of the parietal pleura to affect the chest wall, diaphragm, and distant portions of the mediastinum.
Spread may also occur along the intrapleural space leading to distant pleural seeding. 
Transdiaphragmatic routes of spread, direct spread and distant metastases often occur as a result of hematogenous and lymphatic invasion. 
Metastases to distant extrathoracic sites such as the liver, bone, lymph node, kidneys and brain occur rarely in the late clinical course. 


Differentiation between invasive thymoma and thymic carcinoma is difficult on the basis of CT findings. 
However, thymic carcinomas show a higher rate of mediastinal lymph node and distant metastases than invasive thymoma. Pleural implants in thymic carcinoma are relatively rare in comparison to those in invasive thymoma. 


Anterior mediastinal lymphoma, malignant germ cell tumor, carcinoid and metastasis should be included in the differential diagnosis.

"," Elastofibroma dorsi is a benign fibroelastic lesion of unknown cause, most commonly found in the sub- or infrascapular regions of the chest wall. Elastofibroma is not rare at autopsy, with lesions 3 cm or smaller.
 Elastofibroma is several times more common in women than men, and seen in more than 55 years old. The lesions are periscapsular in 99% of reported cases, and are often bilateral. 

 Although the cause of this lesion is not clear, it has been considered as a pseudotumor, reactive in nature, and attributable to mechanical friction of the scapula against the ribs during heavy manual labor. It can be explained that elastofibroma is thought to be more common on the right side, presumably related to the side of the patients' dominant handedness, and more common in manual laborer. 

 Elastofibroma is usually slow growing and not transformed into malignancy. 

 On CT, elastofibroma is typically a poorly defined, inhomogeneous soft-tissue mass with attenuation similar to that of skeletal muscle, containing linear streaks of fat attenuation. 

 The differential diagnosis of these lesions includes neurofibroma, cicatrical fibroma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma.

  CT and MRI are helpful in characterizing the tumor and in assessing its extent. 
  CT is superior to MR imaging in the demonstration of foci of calcification in chondrosarcoma and osteosarcomas.

The risk of mesothelioma in any asbestos worker is approximately 10 % over his or her lifetime. A history of occupational exposure of asbestos is found in only 40-80 % of patients wit malignant pleural mesothelioma. Usually, a latency period of approximately 20 to 40 years occurs between exposure and detection of tumor (1). Of the various types of asbestos fibers, crocidolite, amosite and tremolite are highly carcinogenic (2). The amount of asbestos exposure needed to produce malignant pleural mesothelioma, or the dose-response relationship, is unknown (3).
 Common radiographic findings include a moderate-to-large amount of pleural effusion with or without a pleural mass or diffuse pleural thickening with or without an effusion. Pleural effusion occurs in 30 % to 80 % of the patients with malignant mesothelioma. 

 Although mediastinal shift to the contralateral side is usually seen in association with massive pleural effusions, it is not a common finding in the patients with malignant mesothelioma. Instead, there may be evidence of volume loss on the affected side wit narrowing of the intercostal spaces, elevation of the hemidiaphragm, and ipsilateral shift of the mediastinum (3).

 Diffuse, unilateral pleural thickening occurs in up to 60 % of patients. Sheet-like or lobulated pleural thickening may encase the lung, grow into the fissures, and create a pleural rind. Mesothelioma may also present as discrete pleural masses (3). Discrete pulmonary masses and hilar mass can also occur. Invasion of the chest wall occurs in far-advanced disease.

 CT is helpful both in the detection of other underlying signs of asbestos exposure, such as pleural plaques, and in determining the extent of tumor. Differential diagnoses include benign asbestos pleurisy, infections, and metastases to the pleura, especially adenocarcinoma.

It may appear in this area as part of the manifestations of the disseminated process or as a primary mediastinal disease. The majority of malignant lymphoma presenting as primary mediastinal neoplasm falls into the following three categories: Hodgkin's lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and large cell lymphoma, in order of frequency. 

 Intrathoracic disease is more common in Hodgkin's disease (HD) than non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). All of the mediastinal nodal groups except the anterior diaphragmatic  (paracardiac) and posterior mediastinal nodes are more frequently involved with HD than NHL. Intrathoracic disease of NHL may follow the patterns described for HD. However, the contiguity of nodal disease typical for HD is frequently absent in NHL. Involvement of the paratracheal and/or prevascular nodal groups is the most common. These are followed by subcarinal nodes, cardiophrenic angle nodes, internal mammary nodes, and posterior mediastinal nodes. In NHL, pulmonary or pleural lesions may be seen without mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. However, it is more common to find some manifestations of mediastinal disease when the lungs are involved.

 Mediastinal large cell lymphomas can present as a mass in the thymus with or without lymph node involvement. Large cell lymphoma of mediastinum is usually restricted to the intrathoracic region at the time of initial presentation. The tumor has grossly invasive features; extension into pericardium, pleura, lung, sternum, and chest wall is common and presentation with superior vena cava syndrome is frequent. Of tumors studied with cell markers, the majority has been found to have B-cell nature, but T-cell malignancies are also present.

 On CT scan, the enlarged nodes in any of the malignant lymphomas may be discrete or matted together, and their edges may be well- or ill-defined. In general, they show only minor enhancement. Low density resulting from cystic degeneration may be seen in both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Endobronchial hamartoma

At bronchoscopy, the lumen of the anteromedial basal segmental bronchus was totally obstructed by endobronchial mass of which surface was inflamed.","Hamartoma is the most common benign tumor of the lung. Most hamartomas are located peripherally in the lung parenchyma, near the pleural surface. 
But, it may occur near the hilum and 3-10% is presented as endobronchial mass.

It is usually small in size and grows slowly. 
The peak incidence is in the sixth decade. 
Endobronchial hamartoma is a special form of the usual intrapulmonary hamartoma, which originates from a large bronchus, grows into the lumen and obstructs the bronchi. 
Therefore, most endobronchial tumors produce symptoms such as cough and fever due to bronchial obstruction. 

Hamartomas contain cartilage, fat, fibrous tissue, and epithelial component. 
Endobronchial lesion tends to have relatively more fat than the parenchymal lesion. 
Only rarely do they contain principally fatty tissue, in which case they are called lipomatous hamartomas or endobronchial lipomas. 

Main CT finding of endobronchial hamartoma is an endobronchial mass with or without obstructive pneumonia. 
In some cases containing fat or calcification, the specific diagnosis of hamartoma can be made.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-88-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-88-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-88-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-88-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-88-5.jpg']",21,"['correct:10/21', 'semi:4/21']"

On mediastinoscopic surgery, a well-defined cystic mass was found.","Bronchogenic cysts are congenital lesions resulting from abnormalities in ventral budding or branching of the bronchopulmonary foregut. 
The lesions have been classified as mediastinal and intrapulmonary types. 
Mediastinal cysts are far more frequent and do not communicate with the bronchial tree, unlike intraparenchymal cysts in which such communications usually develop, leading to frequent recurrent infection. 

Most bronchogenic cysts are most commonly located in the carinal area (52%), followed by paratracheal area (19%), esophageal wall (14%), and retrocardiac area (9%).  
These cysts rarely can be seen in other locations such as the anterior mediastinum, the low posterior mediastinum, or in the lung itself. 

Their classic chest radiographic findings are clearly defined round or oval masses of water density, commonly located just inferior to the carina. 
These thin-walled cysts are lined with respiratory epithelium and cyst fluid is composed primarily of water admixed with varying amounts of thick proteinaceous mucus. Calcium oxalate crystals have also been detected in the fluid. 
This variable fluid composition explains the different CT attenuations observed in bronchogenic cysts. 

Usually, CT of bronchogenic cyst shows a mass with the same attenuation as that of water, reflecting their serous nature. 
However, in one-half of all bronchogenic cysts, the CT density can vary from a low soft-tissue range to higher-than-muscle density, likely due to intracystic hemorrhage, protein, or calcium.


Those patients who are asymptomatic and have small cysts with typical CT findings can be followed. If a malignant neoplasm is suspected because CT findings are atypical or the mass has increased in size, surgery or aspiration may be required for diagnosis and treatment.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-355-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-355-2.jpg']",29,['correct:10/29']

 Benign cystic teratomas are more common than the malignant forms. 
 They usually consist predominantly of ectodermal elements such as skin, sebaceous material, hair, and calcification- hence the expression ""dermoid cyst""- along with smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium.
 Benign cystic teratomas are usually asymptomatic (up to 53%) and symptoms are caused by local compression, rupture, or infection. 
 The most common symptoms are chest pain, cough that is usually productive, dyspnea, and fever. 
 Occasionally patients have pneumonia, hemoptysis, superior vena caval syndrome, or trichoptysis (expectoration of hair).
 Benign cystic teratomas usually produce mass in the anterior mediastinum but a few are found in the posterior mediastinum or lung.
 CT findings are variable. Water density in the cystic component is common, and fat density is seen in one fourth to one half of the patients. 
 A definite cyst wall, which may show curvilinear calcification, is often visible. 
 These tumors rarely rupture into the adjacent structures, such as the pleural space, pericardium, lung parenchyma, or tracheobronchial tree. 
 Proteolytic or digestive enzymes derived from the tumor have been proposed as the cause of tumoral rupture. 
 When the tumor is ruptured, these enzymes can cause inflammation and necrosis of adjacent organs. 
 All ruptured mediastinal teratomas had a tendency to display inhomogeneity of the internal component, whereas 90% of unruptured masses showed homogenous densities of internal components in each compartment of the mass. 
 Ancillary CT findings (such as a fat-containing mass, consolidation, or atelectasis in the adjacent lung) are important for detecting rupture in the mediastinal teratomas.
 Pleural effusion was one of the most common ancillary CT findings (57%) in ruptured mediastinal teratomas. 
 Pericardial effusion, especially in-patients with a teratoma adhering to the pericardium, also appeared to suggest rupture of the tumor into the pericardium.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-357-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-357-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-357-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-357-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-357-5.jpg']",23,['correct:6/23']

He showed a mild increase of BUN and creatinine, suggesting renal dysfunction. 
Initial arterial blood gas study revealed hypoxemia and compensatory hyperventilation. 

One or two days after admission he demonstrated respiratory distress with decreased oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2) less than 200, and rapidly progressing bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography.

Follow-up chest radiograph 5 days later after treatment shows marked improvement of lung opacities.","Leptospirosis is a zoonotic diseases caused by Leptospira interrogans in rodent and wild animals. 
Human disease is acquired by contact with urine or tissues of an infected animal or through contaminated water or soil. Systemic infection of leptospirosis shows variable clinical symptoms and signs from indolent and fatal manifestation with multi-organ failure. 

Leptospirosis can be complicated by ARDS, which needs the treatment of underlying disease and adequate supportive care with artificial mechanical ventilation. 
The main causes of the disease, we believe, are heavy rain and water flooding during the summer, which leads to wide propagation of Leptospira. 
Leptospirosis can occur as two clinical manifestations: 
a self-limiting anicteric systemic illness, which occurs in 85-90 % of the disease, 
and a septicemic leptospirosis, 10-15 % of patients. 

Systemic leptospirosis is characterized by abrupt onset of chills, fever, headache, and myalgia. 
Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can occur occasionally. 
Weil's disease, icteric leptospirosis, is the severest form of the disease and characterized by the presence of impaired renal and hepatic function, multi-organ internal hemorrhage, vascular collapse, and severe alteration in consciousness. 

The radiologic findings of the lung are reported as three forms: 
(1) multiple nodular opacities (air-space nodules) ranging from 1 to 7 mm in diameter with or without associated focal areas of consolidation (57%); 
(2) large confluent areas of consolidation (16%); and 
(3) diffuse, ill-defined areas of ground-glass opacity (27%). 

In all patients, the abnormalities were bilateral and nonlobar in distribution; in approximately 50%, they involved mainly the peripheral lung regions.

Nonenhanced CT scan demonstrates a homogeneous, smoothly marginated, right posterior mediastinal mass (mean attenuation: 60 HU) abutting the trachea and esophagus. 
On contrast enhanced CT scan, the mass does not show contrast enhancement (mean attenuation: 55 HU). 
","Esophageal duplication cysts are uncommon and constitute only 0.5 - 2.5 % of all esophageal tumors (1,2). Of duplication cysts, 60% are located in the lower esophagus. 
The rest are distributed equally between the upper and middle thirds of the esophagus (2). 
Duplication cysts of congenital origin may be attached to the esophagus in a paraesophageal location or may be intramural. 
Attached cysts often protruded into the posterior mediastinum and may up to 5 cm in diameter (3). 
Esophageal duplication cysts probably result from developmental errors occurring at the fifth to eight week of life (2). Embryologically, esophageal duplication cysts are believed to represent a failure of complete vacuolation of the originally solid esophagus to produce a hollow tube. 
They are lined by nonkeratinizing squamous or ciliated columnar epithelium: a double layer of smooth muscle in their walls and absence of cartilage are necessary findings to exclude a diagnosis of bronchial cyst (4).

Radiologic findings using multiple methods are often non-specific. 
Chest radiographs may show a middle or posterior mediastinal mass. 
Barium swallow examination may demonstrate a smooth, rounded impression on the esophagus. 
Radionuclide scans using Tc99m sodium pertechnetate may be helpful in children, in whom 50% of thoracic duplication cysts contain ectopic gastric mucosa (5). 

Typical CT finding of esophageal duplication cyst is a homogeneous, low-attenuation mass with smooth borders (6).
Although CT cannot definitely differentiate an esophageal duplication cyst from other benign paraesophageal lesions such as abscess, old hematoma, neurofibroma, lipoma, leiomyoma, or other foregut duplications, it can often suggest a presumptive diagnosis (7).

","A fungus ball can be defined as a conglomeration of interwined fungal hyphae admixed with mucus and cellular debris within pulmonary cavity or ectatic bronchus. 
The most common underlying cause is tuberculosis, approximately 25 to 50% of patients having a history of this disease. 
Other predisposing conditions associated less often with aspergilloma formation include bronchiectasis of any cause, chronic fungal cavities, bronchogenic cysts, acute and chronic bacterial abscesses, cavities related to P. carinii in patient with AIDS, cavitary carcinoma, radiation fibrosis, and so on. 

Radiologically, a fungus ball consists of a solid, more or less round mass of soft tissue density within a spherical or ovoid cavity. 
Typically, the mass is separated from the wall of the cavity by an air space, resulting in the distinctive air crescent sign. As on the radiographs, the most characteristic finding of aspergilloma on CT consists of an ovoid or round soft tissue intracavitary mass. 
Areas of increase attenuation, presumably representing calcium deposit, are relatively common. 
CT may also demonstrate fungal fronds situated on the cavity wall that intersect with each other and form an irregular sponge-like network, before the development to the mature fungus ball. 
Occasionally, the mycelial mass grows to fill a cavity completely, effectively obliteration the air space necessary for its radiographic identification. 
The fungus ball usually moves when the patient changes position. 
Calcification of the fungus ball occurs in some cases; this may be apparent as scattered small nodules, as a find rim around the periphery of the mass, or as an extensive process involving the greater part of the mycetoma.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-305-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-305-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-305-3.jpg']",33,"['correct:17/33', 'semi:9/33']"

HRCT scans through the upper, middle and lower lung zones, respectively, show tiny centrilobular nodules and branching opacities. 
Centrilobular opacities can be divided into two types according to size. 
The larger ones are seen as sharply demarcated, rounded nodules and the smaller ones, more frequent in number, are seen as relatively ill-defined nodular or branching opacities. 
These opacities are distributed fairly uniformly throughout the lungs. Subpleural nodules are also seen.","   The International Labor Office (ILO) classification of radiographs of pneumoconiosis is now used worldwide. The opacities caused by dust inhalation are divided according to whether they are round or irregular in shape. Those that are round are classified according to size as p, q, or r (p, up to 1.5 mm in diameter; q, 1.5 ~ 3 mm; r, 3 ~ 10 mm). Those classified as irregular are designated as fine, medium, or coarse, using the letters s, t, and u, respectively. As might be expected, the interobserver variability in categorizing small opacities is great. 
   On CT, nodules of the q and r types were characterized by sharply demarcated, rounded nodules or irregular, contracted nodules that are centrilobular or subpleural in distribution. Nodules are present diffusely and bilaterally, but upper lobe and posterior predominance of nodules is often visible on CT. Nodules occurring in relation to thickened interlobular septa can be seen. In contrast, Akira et al. reviewed the HRCT scans in 55 patients with radiographic type p pneumoconiosis. In those patients with radiographic type p pneumoconiosis, HRCT showed ill-defined centrilobular opacities, sometimes having the appearance of small branching structures or a few closely spaced dots. In 21 of the 55 patients, nonperipheral, small areas of low attenuation with central dot were found. On the basis of CT-pathologic correlation, these centrilobular opacities and areas of low attenuation corresponded to irregular fibrosis around and along the respiratory bronchiole and to focal-dust emphysema, respectively. On HRCT, therefore, type p pneumoconiosis could be considered in the differential diagnosis for disease entities manifesting as bronchiolitis. In our case, centrilobular opacities were present as a mixed pattern consisting of the nodules of p type and of q type. However, nodules of the p type were, on the whole, more predominant.
   In summary, HRCT appearance of radiographic type p pneumoconiosis is different from that of type q or r pneumoconiosis consisting of distinct rounded opacities. In contrast, radiographic type p pneumoconiosis is characterized by tiny centrilobular opacities and frequent areas of low attenuation on HRCT. These centrilobular opacities are pathologically regarded as lesions of respiratory bronchiole.     


PATIENT'S CLINICAL COURSE AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

   This patient, a 46-year-old farmer, presented to a hospital other than ours with hematuria. He was diagnosed as having bladder cancer on the basis of clinical and cystoscopic findings in that hospital, where he did not receive any treatment. He was subsequently transferred to our hospital for treatment. On admission, he showed no symptoms and signs except intermittent hematuria. Because miliary pattern was found on routine preoperative chest radiograph, he underwent chest HRCT scanning for evaluation of miliary disease. We thought the lung lesions were less likely to be miliary tuberculosis because fever, a very common sign of miliary tuberculosis, was not present recently and miliary nodules were less numerous on HRCT in this case than in patients with typical miliary tuberculosis. The possibility of hematogenous metastasis could not be ruled out at that time because of the presence of multiple, sharply demarcated, small nodules on HRCT. He eventually underwent thoracoscopic lung biopsy after a nondiagnostic transbronchial biopsy. 
   On pathologic examination, there were multiple dense fibrotic nodules in lung specimens. These nodules were composed of whorled collagen and reticulin centrally, with surrounding fibroblast, lymphocytes, and macrophages containing dust particles. Refractile particles could be seen at the center of lesions. These histologic features corresponded to the silicotic nodules; there was no evidence of caseating or noncaseating granulomas or malignant tumor. After the pathologic diagnosis was made, careful questioning of the patient revealed that he had worked underground in a mine for 12 years from 22 to 33 years old.  
   In this case, the differential diagnosis includes miliary tuberculosis, metastasis, pneumoconiosis, and sarcoidosis. In miliary tuberculosis, the size of nodules are relatively uniform throughout the lungs and the number of those are usually more numerous than in our case. Additionally, patients with miliary tuberculosis commonly have a fever. In hematogenous metastasis, metastatic nodules are usually smooth, well-defined and round in shape except for hemorrhagic tumor. They are usually variable in size and do not show ill-defined, fine centrilobular nodular or branching opacities. In contrast to miliary tuberculosis and metastasis spreading through the bloodstream, sarcoidosis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas primarily distributed along the lymphatics. The characteristic HRCT abnormality of sarcoidosis is the nodular thickening of peribronchovascular interstitium. Interlobular septa and pleural surfaces are also frequently involved. When sarcoid granulomas involve the peribronchovascular interstitium of the lobular core, centrilobular nodules can be seen. However, these are not usually a predominant feature on HRCT.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-237-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-237-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-237-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-237-4.jpg']",36,"['correct:8/36', 'semi:12/36']"

Diffuse form of BAC (bronchioloalveolar carcinoma), malignant lymphoma, and active pulmonary tuberculosis can be considered in the pictures like these.","Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma is characterized pathologically by lepidic growth with preservation of lung architecture. The most frequent symptoms and signs in patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma include cough, sputum, shortness of breath, weight loss, hemoptysis, and fever. Bronchorrhea, once considered the clinical hallmark of this disease, is unusual and is a late manifestation seen only with diffuse bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (1, 2). 

  The radiologic manifestations of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma are diverse and include single or multiple pulmonary nodules, segmental or lobar consolidation and diffuse airspace disease. Alveolar filling disorders are usually seen in forms of segmental or lobar and diffuse airspace disease. The lobar consolidative form accounts for approximately 30% of all bronchioloalveolar carcinomas and corresponds to a mucinous histologic type. The airspace consolidation is caused by growth along the alveolar wall combined with secretion of mucin.

  Production of copious amounts of mucin may result in expansion of the involved lobe, leading to bulging of interlobar fissures. The CT angiogram sign is caused by the homogeneous low attenuation of consolidation, which allows vessels to be clearly seen, particularly after intravenous administration of contrast material. The CT angiogram sign is nonspecific and may also be seen in lobar pneumonia, pulmonary lymphoma, extrinsic lipid pneumonia, pulmonary infarction, and pulmonary edema. According to recent report by Akira et al (3), diffuse bronchioloalveolar carcinoma can be classified into three patterns: ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and multiple nodules (the most common pattern is ground-glass opacity). Areas of ground-glass opacity are found both around and remote from the consolidation or nodule.

According to Kradin et al, 
the median age was 56 years, and 80 percent (eight) of the patients were men. 
All patients are or were cigarette smokers. 
Sixty percent (six) had a history of exposure to either asbestos, nonfibrous silicates, or both. 
Forty percent (four) had an unexplained pulmonary nodule or nodules on the chest roentgenogram, which prompted further diagnostic studies, including thoracotomy, to rule out a malignant neoplasm. 
Radiographically, in our cases and in the literature, almost all cases of intrapulmonary lymph nodes are 
subpleural, inferior to the level of the carina, and less than 2.0 cm in diameter. 
Thirty-five percent are multiple. 
Pathologically, in our cases, all intrapulmonary lymph nodes were markedly anthracotic, 
and 60 percent were additionally silicotic. 
Although their histogenesis is uncertain, intrapulmonary lymph nodes are probably hyperplastic lymphoid nodules related to inhalation of irritant dusts and attendant distortion of local lymphatic vessels. 

According to Yokomise et al, 
IPLNs were located in the lower lobe in 72%. 
The characteristic CT findings of IPLNs were a clear border and location close to the pleura. 
We found that IPLNs located underneath the pleura are important to consider in the differential diagnosis of lung cancer. 
The CT scan findings of IPLNs were not necessarily specific and sometimes resembled those of lung cancer. Because of their location, video-assisted thoracic surgery is useful in making a definite diagnosis.

According to Park et al and Kim et al, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis is most commonly revealed as 
patchy subpleural areas of ground-glass opacity mixed with irregular linear opacity or bronchial dilatation on HRCT. 
These areas represent interstitial thickening caused by varying degrees of interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, or both. 

According to Hartman et al, there are a wide variety of CT findings in cases of NSIP. 
Eleven (22%) of the 50 patients had CT findings that were compatible with previous descriptions of NSIP.

Fig. 2. Chest radiograph immediately after placement of the chest tube (10 hr after pleurocentesis) demonstrates diffuse consolidations of both lungs. The right pleural effusion was almost evacuated.
","Reexpansion pulmonary edema is a rare complication attending the rapid reexpansion of a chronically collapsed lung, such as occurs after evacuation of a large amount of air or fluid from the pleural space. 

As a rare occasion, it may also develop after reexpansion of collapsed lung by laser bronchoscopic resection of occlusive endobronchial tumor.

The condition usually appears unexpectedly and dramatically-immediately or within 1 h in 64% of patients and within 24 h in the remainder. 

The clinical manifestations are varied; they range from roentgenographic findings alone in asymptomatic patients to severe cardiorespiratory insufficiency. 

The radiographic evidence of reexpansion pulmonary edema is a unilateral alveolar filling pattern, seen within a few hours of reexpansion of the lung. 

The edema may progress for 24-48 h and persist for 4-5 days. 

The pathophysiology of reexpansion pulmonary edema remains obscure. 
Various hypotheses regarding the mechanism of reexpansion pulmonary edema include 
1.      increased pulmonary capillary permeability due to hypoxic injury, 
2.      decreased surfactant production, and 
3.      altered pulmonary perfusion and mechanical stretching of membranes. 

Reexpansion pulmonary edema usually occurs in ipsilateral lung reexpanded following pleurocentesis, but rarely bilateral pulmonary edema may occur following unilateral pleurocentesis. 

Ragozzino et al. (2) hypothesized that reexpansion pulmonary edema can involve the opposite lung when there is significant contralateral lung compression. 

Removal of the large volume of fluid or air results in acute reexpansion of both lungs. 

Thus, the potential mechanisms that alter capillary permeability are present bilaterally.

Treatment is basically preventive. 

Only supportive therapy can be offered once reexpansion pulmonary edema has developed. 

Several clinical prognoses have been reported in the literature with a 15 to 20% mortality despite use of mechanical ventilation in particularly serious situations.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-563-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-563-2.jpg']",41,['correct:41/41']

 At autopsy, it was reported to be present in up to 60-80% of patients with chronic renal failure. However, calcification is rarely identified on chest radiograph. Metastatic calcifications commonly consist of parenchymal opacification or poorly defined infiltrates that may simulate pneumonia or pulmonary edema (3-6).

 On CT scan, multiple pulmonary nodules and calcification can be seen. In addition to the pulmonary nodules, CT scans can show the presence of calcification in the vessels of the chest wall. 

 These findings of CT are valuable to differentiate from other causes of pulmonary calcification (tuberculosis, fungal infection, varicella, silicosis, sarcoidosis, metastatic tumor, rheumatic mitral stenosis, alveolar microlithiasis, idiopathic pulmonary ossification (7).

 Metastatic pulmonary calcification is a purely interstitial process. The predominant site of calcium deposition is alveolar septa and, to a lesser extent, the pulmonary arterioles, bronchioles, accounting for the lack of interlobular septal thickening.

 In the patients with chronic renal failure and primary hyperparathyroidism, excess production of parathyroid hormone makes increased uptake of radionuclide in both lung zones on 99mTc-MDP bone scans.

Abstract of an AJR article by Hartman et al.
Metastatic calcification was due to chronic renal failure (n = 4), T-cell leukemia (n = 1), multiple endocrine neoplasia type I syndrome (n = 1), and idiopathic hypercalcemia (n = 1). 
Numerous nodular opacities measuring 3-10 mm in diameter were seen on the chest radiographs in five cases, and patchy areas of parenchymal opacification were seen in two cases. Calcification of the nodules was evident in two cases. On CT scans, pulmonary nodules were present in all seven cases. These nodules were predominant in the upper lung zone in three cases, were diffuse in three cases, and were predominant in the lower lung zone in one case. Calcification of the nodules was evident on the CT scans in four of the seven cases, and calcification of vessels in the chest wall was evident in six of seven cases. Other findings on CT scans included diffuse areas of ground-glass attenuation (n = 3) and patchy consolidation (n = 2). 
Numerous small nodules are the most common finding on the chest radiographs of patients with metastatic pulmonary calcification. The calcific nature of the nodules is seldom obvious, however. Pulmonary nodules are also the most common finding on CT scans, where the calcific nature of the nodules is more readily apparent. Additionally, calcification is often seen in the vessels of the chest wall on CT scans. The combination of calcified nodules and calcified vessels in the chest wall on CT scans may be characteristic.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-437-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-437-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-437-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-437-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-437-5.jpg']",40,"['correct:20/40', 'semi:10/40']"

Follow-up chest radiograph shows consolidation of right lung, predominantly in upper lung zone. 
Cardiomegaly is persistently observed and sternotomy is due to previous mitral valve replacement operation. 

CT scans show consolidation localized in RUL and RML. 
Calcified pleural thickening, cardiomegaly and widely opened artificial mitral valvular annuli are observed as well. ","Atypical radiologic presentation of pulmonary edema has been described in the literature in relation to various causes:
(1) gravitational effect (prolonged lateral decubitus); 
(2) alterations in lung perfusion (pulmonary thromboembolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Swyer-James syndrome); 
(3) alterations in pulmonary venous drainage (unilateral veno-occlusive disease, atrial myxoma); 
(4) alterations in intrapleural pressure (abrupt pneumothorax re-expansion); and 
(5) alterations in pulmonary ventilation (bronchial obstruction),etc (1-3).

One of the lesser known atypical forms of radiographic presentation of pulmonary edema is the isolated or predominant affection of the right upper lobe in patients with mitral valve insufficiency.

Schnyder et al (4) found radiographic signs of vascular congestion and edema restricted to or predominantly in the RUL in 12 of 131 patients (9%) with severe mitral regurgitation.

The pathogenic mechanism that has been suggested is a regurgitation jet produced in the left ventricular systole in patients with mitral valve insufficiency, with a retrograde flow toward the left atrium. 
This jet is oriented especially toward the orifice of the right upper pulmonary vein. 
The blood flow, so directed, will increase the formation of edema by accentuating the Starling forces (4, 5). 
Associated affection of the RML with the RUL may occurs since the middle lobar vein frequently empties in the left atrium in a joint venous confluent, together with the right upper lobar vein.

Alarcon et al. (6) suggested that certain signs and symptoms might be help with the differential radiologic diagnosis of this entity with respect to other processes with an identical presentation:
1.      Patients usually present with clinical symptoms of left heart failure (dyspnea, cough).
2.      In the presence of a personal history of mitral valvulopathy, atypical localized pulmonary edema in the RUL should be considered as the first possibility.
3.      If there is no additional infection, fever or other infectious signs are absent.
4.      Cardiomegaly is common.
5.      It is usually accompanied by additional radiologic findings of postcapillary pulmonary hypertension (inverted blood flow distribution, pulmonary vascular blurring, central peribronchial cuffing, septal lines, pleural effusion, etc.).
6.      In some cases, the special distribution of the edema fluid, in a central disposition, unlike that which one would expect to find in an infectious process, may provide additional diagnostic information.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-564-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-564-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-564-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-564-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-564-5.jpg']",28,['correct:6/28']

The last two images are delayed images.",Actinomycosis,"CT scans show segmental consolidation in right upper lobe.
Delayed images shows tubular branching structures of low attenuation within the mildly-enhancing consolidation.","Actinomycosis is caused by members of the family Actinomycetaceae. 
The most important cause of disease in humans is A. israelii. 
This organism is characterized by its mycelial granules, which are usually called sulfur granules because of their yellow color. 

The organisms are normal inhabitants of the human oropharynx, especially in persons with poor oral hygine. 
In the majority of cases, disease is aquired by the direct spread of endogenous organisms from the oropharynx into the lung or into the gastrointestinal tract. 
Most infections occur in individuals who are not immunocompromised. 

Grossly, chronic pulmonary actinomycosis is characterized by multiple abscesses interconnected by granulating sinus tracts and surrounded by a variable amount of fibrous tissue. 

Histologically, the abscesses are composed of an outer rim of grannulation tissue surrounding masses of polymorphonuclear leukocytes that often contain typical sulfur granules. 
Surrounding lung parenchyma shows a variable degree of fibrosis and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. 

The typical pattern in the acute variety of actinomycosis consists of airspace pneumonia, without recognizable segmental distribution, commonly in the periphery of the lung and with a predilection for the lower lobes. 

With appropriate therapy, most cases resolve without complications.

Actinomycosis frequently presents roentgenographically as a mass that simulates pulmonary carcinoma. 
According to the many articles and textbook, extension across the pleural fissures and into the chest wall is common. However, recent study for the radiologic findings of thoracic actinomycosis in SNUH (1) revealed that all 22 patients showed no evidence of chest wall involvement.

Abstract of an article about CT findings of thoracic actinomycosis by Cheon et al (1)

PURPOSE: To characterize computed tomographic (CT) findings of thoracic actinomycosis. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
Chest CT scans and radiographs obtained in 22 patients with histopathologically proved thoracic actinomycosis were retrospectively reviewed. 
All patients were immunocompetent; they were aged 12-73 years (mean, 42.6 years; 14 male, eight female). 
CT findings were correlated with histopathologic findings in nine patients who underwent surgery (lobectomy [n = 8] or segmental resection [n = 1]). 

RESULTS: 
All of the lesions were unilateral, with an average diameter of 6.5 cm (range, 2-12 cm). 
Patchy air-space consolidation (n = 20) or a mass (n = 2) was seen on CT scans. 
Fifteen (75%) of the 20 patients with air-space consolidation had central areas of low attenuation (5-30 mm in diameter) within the consolidation. 
Thirteen of the 15 patients underwent contrast medium-enhanced CT. 
Ten (77%) of the 13 patients showed ring-like rim enhancement. 
Adjacent pleural thickening was seen in 16 patients (73%). 
At histopathologic examination, central low-attenuation areas at CT were seen as microabscesses with sulfur granules or a dilated bronchus that contained inflammatory cells and Actinomyces colonies. 
Peripheral enhancement of the low-attenuation areas was wall of the microabscess or surrounding parenchyma composed of granulation tissue rich in vascularity. 

CONCLUSION:
Findings of chronic segmental air-space consolidation that contained low-attenuation areas with peripheral enhancement or adjacent pleural thickening at CT were suggestive of thoracic actinomycosis.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-302-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-302-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-302-3.jpg']",23,"['correct:4/23', 'semi:6/23']"

  Contrast-enhanced CT scan shows a well-demarcated cystic mass in the anterior mediastinum. 
  The wall of the mass is thick and well enhanced. 

Pathology:
Specimen photographs after mass excision show a well-demarcated cyst with yellow internal contents.
","The majority of mediastinal teratomas are cystic and benign; the relatively uncommon solid forms are usually malignant. Pathologically, tumors can be divided into three types including mature teratomas, immature teratomas, and teratomas with malignant transformation. 

Mature cystic teratomas are found at all ages, but particularly in adolescents and young adults, with females slightly outnumbering males. They usually consist predominantly of ectodermal elements-hence the expression ""dermoid cyst""-such as skin, sebaceous material, hair, and calcification along with smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium. In most series half the cases are asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally on chest radiography or CT. Symptoms are caused by local compression, rupture, or infection. The most common symptoms are chest pain, a cough that is usually productive, dyspnea, and fever.

Mature cystic teratomas usually produce a well-defined, rounded or lobulated mass in anterior mediastinum in front of the roots of the aorta and main pulmonary artery, but a few are found in the posterior mediastinum or lung. Benign cysts grow slowly, but rapid increase in size may occur because of hemorrhage. Alternatively, they may rupture into the bronchial tree in which case air may enter the cyst and be visible on imaging examinations. Rarely the cyst may rupture into the pericardium or pleura, in which case a fat-fluid level may be visible in the pleural space. Most teratomas project mainly to one side of the midline, sometimes markedly so. Calcification, ossification, or even teeth may be visible on a chest radiograph, and occasionally, sufficient fat is present to be detectable radiographically. 

The findings at CT are variable. Water density in the cystic component is common, and fat density is seen in one fourth to one half of the patients. A fat-fluid level may be seen, or fat and fluid may be more immediately mixed. A definite cyst wall, which may show curvilinear calcification, is often visible. The combination of a large anterior mediastinal mass, which is wholly or predominantly composed of a cyst, with a well-defined wall is highly suggestive of a cystic teratoma. With calcification in the wall of the cyst or small spherical or irregular calcifications within the mass, cystic teratoma is even more likely. Unequivocal fat within the mass, particularly a fat-fluid level, makes this diagnosis certain.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-359-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-359-2.jpg']",28,"['correct:19/28', 'semi:6/28']"

HRCT scans show multifocal areas of consolidation, ground-glass attenuation, and irregular linear opacities in both lungs. Mild bronchial dilatation is noted within the consolidation.

CT scans with mediastinal window setting show mild pleural thickening and parenchymal lesions of relatively high attenuation.","Amiodarone hydrochloride (Cordane) is an effective antiarrhythmic drug that can cause fatal pneumonitis. 
The drug usually accumulates in the liver and in the lung, where its half-life is extremely long (25-60 days). 
The reported prevalence of pulmonary toxicity in the patients receiving amiodarone ranges from 1.4% to 18%. 
Mortality due to pulmonary toxicity is as high as 20-30%. 
Clinical indications of amiodarone toxicity range from acute onset of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath to more indolent symptoms of malaise, fever, cough and dyspnea.

Conventional radiographic findings are area of consolidation, infiltration, or interstitial disease, findings that are entirely nonspecific and easily confused with pulmonary abnormalities caused by congestive heart failure, pneumonia and pulmonary infarction. 
Ga-67 imaging has been used to detect amiodarone toxicity, but although very sensitive to inflammation, Ga-67 imaging is not disease or drug specific. 

CT findings indicative of significant amiodarone exposure included high-attenuation parenchymal-pleural lesion, and increased liver and/or spleen attenuation. 
CT findings of high attenuation parenchymal pleural abnormalities are thought to be related to the iodinated chemistry of the drug and its prolonged half-life within the lung.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-241-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-241-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-241-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-241-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-241-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-241-6.jpg']",40,['correct:35/40']

It is located in anterior aspect of the cardiac silhouette on lateral chest radiograph and has thin calcified wall.

Non-enhanced CT scan demonstrates a 4 cm-sized ovoid mass that is located in interventricular septal groove and abuts to the anterior descending left coronary artery. 
Contrast enhanced CT scan demonstrates the mass is enhanced as well as aorta.

Coronary angiography (below) shows an about 4 cm-sized saccular aneurysm arising from the anterior descending left coronary artery.
","Aneurysm is uncommon for the coronary artery system. 
Coronary artery aneurysms are noted in 0.2% to 4.9% of patients undergoing coronary arteriography. 
The most widely accepted definition is a more than one and half times the diameter of adjacent normal segments of the largest coronary artery and is classified into being saccular or fusiform and single or multiple. 
The proximal and middle segments of the right coronary artery were most frequently involved and the next most frequently involved segments were the proximal left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries, and multiple in 25% of patients. 
Such aneurysms occur three times as frequently in men as in women. 
The most common cause of the coronary artery aneurysm is atherosclerotic coronary artery disease in about half of all patients. 
Other leading causes include Kawasaki disease, polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus, syphilis, rheumatic fever and trauma. 
The pathogenesis of coronary artery aneurysm is most likely related to injury of the intima overlying intrinsic disease of the media, causing dilatation of the vessel and intima ulceration. 
Many patients are first seen with angina or myocardial infarction, but currently the diagnosis is most often obtained based on an unexpected finding at cardiac catheterization. 
The patients with aneurysmal disease had a significantly higher incidence of myocardial infarction than coronary stenosis only. 
The saccular aneurysms are at higher risk for rupture or thrombosis than those with fusiform aneurysms. Surgery has generally been reserved for symptomatic patients.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-565-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-565-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-565-3.jpg']",41,"['correct:23/41', 'semi:11/41']"

The left decubitus image shows shifting of the opacity. 
Contrast-enhanced CT scans through the lower thorax demonstrate very low attenuating tissue in the left middle and lower pleural space. 
There are multiple vessels of vertical direction in that tissue (mesenteric vessels). 
Diaphragmatic defect is not demonstrated.","In infants, herniation through a persistent embryonic pleuroperitoneal hiatus is not only the most common form of diaphragmatic hernia but also by far the most serious. 
Its incidence is 1 in 2,200 live births. 
Seventy five to 90% occur on the left side. 

When large, the hernias are associated with high death rate unless surgically corrected.
In adults, small Bochdalek's hernias are much more common than in infants and always unassociated with symptoms. 
Their incidence increases with age, suggesting that they are acquired. 
In one review of CT scans of the chest and abdomen performed in 940 adult patients, 60 Bochdalek's hernias were found in 52 patients, a prevalence of 6%.  

On the chest radiography, Bochdalek's hernias can present as a focal bulge in the hemidiaphragm or as a mass adjacent to the posteromedial aspect of either hemidiaphragm. 
Although the diagnosis can often be suspected by the typical location and by the lower than soft tissue density of the mass as a result of its fat content, the appearance can mimic that of pulmonary, mediastinal, or paravertebral masses. 
The diagnosis is readily made on CT. 
Occasionally, spiral CT with coronal or sagittal reformations may be required to demonstrate the defects.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-414-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-414-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-414-3.jpg']",40,"['correct:20/40', 'semi:12/40']"

On lung setting, well-marginated ovoid mass with beaking along the left major fissure, suggesting pleura-originated mass.","This rare tumor occurs more often in women and about 50 years at presentation. 
The etiology is unknown, but in some cases, tumor developed after radiation therapy to the chest wall. 
Symptomatic hypoglycemia has been documented in about 5% of patients and more common in malignant rather than benign tumors and three times in women.

Approximately 70% of solitary fibrous tumors arise in relation to the visceral pleura. 
Most project into the pleural space and compress the adjacent lung. 
Some tumors arising in mediastinal pleura extend into the mediastinum and those in a fissure extend into pulmonary parenchyma like this case. 

These tumors are spherical or oval and well circumscribed; 
many are attached to the pleura by a short vascular pedicle; 
tapering margin and forming obtuse angles with the chest wall or mediastinum. 

A change in position of pedunculated tumor with respiration or change in body position is considerable diagnostic point. 
Cystic formation, calcification, hemorrhage, and necrosis can be present in all benign nature, however, 
although these findings are seen in large tumors, especially, last two findings should rise the possibility of malignancy. 

Pleural effusion is uncommonly seen, but occurs more commonly in malignant tumors. 
A greater portion of malignant tumor arise in the parietal pleura.

Enhancement is equal to or greater than that of muscle after contrast administration. 
But some reported that the tumor less than 6 cm showed homogeneous, whereas larger one had inhomogeneous, related to myxoid or cystic degeneration or hemorrhage.

   Loeffler's syndrome may be idiopathic (cryptogenic), or it may result from a variety of inciting agents, particularly drugs, parasites, and miscellaneous agents such as nickel carbonyl. Presentation has been noted to vary seasonally. The prognosis is excellent.

   Pathologically, there is an eosinophilic pneumonia with edema and an esosinophilic infiltrate in both alveoli and interstitium. Radiographically the findings are one or more fairly homogeneous, nonsegmental consolidations that can be small or so large as to occupy much of a lobe.

Yeast-like organisms with thick capsule in multinucleated giant cells (PAS stain).","Cryptococcus neoformans is an ubiquitous yeast with a worldwide distribution and its natural habitat is the soil, especially that containing pigeon or other avian excreta. 

Cryptococcosis is caused by inhalation of spores of Cryptococcus neoformans. Principal sites of disease include lungs, CNS, blood, skin, bone, joints and prostate.Approximately one third of patients are asymptomatic, whereas the rest symptoms range from mild cough and low-grade fever to an acute, febrile, life-threatening illness. Approximately one half to two thirds of the cases of symptomatic infection are associated with immunodeficiency.Cryptococcosis is a major fungal disease in patients with AIDS, usually presenting as meningitis, pulmonary infiltrates, or both. Other risk factors for cryptococcosis include treated malignancies, organ transplantation with immunosupression, collagen vascular disease (especially with corticosteroid therapy), and chronic heart failure. Immunocompromised patients differ from immunocompetent individuals both in the tissue response to the organism and in the course of the disease. The disease can spread rapidly throughout the lungs and disseminate to extrapulmonary sites, especially the meninges in immunocompromised patients. In contrast, it is more usual in immunocompetent hosts for the infection to be localized to one area of the lung. Histopathologic features are different between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. In immunocompetent patients, granulomatous response occurs. The response may consist of numerous noncaseating granulomas, or there may be extensive caseation. Yeasts can be found both within the necrotic centers of granulomas and within multinucleated histiocytes. In immunocompromised patients, little, if any, inflammatory reaction occurs. Instead, intact alveolar spaces become filled with the yeasts. Vascular invasion, especially of capillaries, may be prominent. McDonnell et al. reported that organisms were present in alveolar capillaries in 27 % of the patient group with chronic debilitating disease.

Radiographically, single or multiple nodular densities are the most common findings. Cavitation occurs in 10-15% of cases. Segmental consolidation and miliary pattern are seen less commonly. Hilar and mediastinal adenopathy may accompany any of these patterns, as may pleural effusion. Cryptococcal pneumonia in AIDS patients shows somewhat different features from those described in non immunocompromised patients in that nodular masses are uncommon and lymphadenopathy is a frequent findings.

Diagnosis can be established based on identification of the characteristic yeast-like organism with capsule in tissue with India ink, silver or mucicarmine stain. Diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis can be established by transbronchial or transthoracic biopsy. In AIDS patients, BAL often will demonstrate organisms cytologically or by culture.

Most patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis do not need treatment.

Thin section CT scan obtained at the level of the aortic arch shows irregular cysts of various sizes in left upper lobe with areas of ground glass opacity. At lower level, Centrilobular nodules with branching opacities are seen in both lungs. Small air cysts are also seen in within consolidation.
Sputum studies revealed acid fast bacilli.","CT findings of pulmonary tuberculosis that appeared as multiple cystic lesions associated with air space consolidation were very rare. Ko et al, reported three cases of reversible cystic changes of pulmonary tuberculosis for the first time in 1997. They suggested three possible pathogenesis of this phenomenon: 1) drainage of necrotic lung parenchymal in the areas of consolidation, coupled with check-valve bronchiolar obstruction caused by edematous luminal narrowing with mural inflammation of the involved bronchiole; 2) areas of dilated bronchioles due to peribronchiolar fibrosis induced by granulomatous lesion in the bronchiolar walls; 3) interstitial air leakage with tubercle rupture and caseation necrosis. 
With the antituberculous chemotherapy, the cystic lesions disappear and residual irregular lines remained on follow-up radiographs and CT scans. 

Pulmonary tuberculosis with multiple cysts needs to be differentiated from othe cystic lung diseases, particularly P carinii pneumonia, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, sarcoidosis, and cystic lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia.

The patient had a recent history of admission in other hospital due to putaminal hemorrhage one month before. There was no known history of significant chest trauma.","Understanding the anatomy of the intrapleural and extrapleural compartment is important in interpreting CT scans of pleural and pleural space disease. The normal visceral and parietal pleurae together form a thickness of approximately 0.2-0.4mm. Just external to the parietal pleura are a fat layer, the endothoracic fascia, and the innermost intercostal muscle.
On high-resolution CT scans of healthy individuals, the pleura and these structures are seen in combination as a line 1-2mm thick in the anterolateral and posterolateral intercostal spaces. Beyond this line and between the ribs lies the intercostal fat, which contains the intercostal vessels and nerve. Outside this fat layer lie the intercostal muscles. Normally, on conventional CT scans the visceral and parietal pleurae internal to the rib surface are not visible, and extension of a soft-tissue stripe internal to the rib is therefore considered a sign of pleural thickening or effusion. The extrapleural fat (the fat layer between the parietal pleura and the endothoracic fascia) commonly thickens in association with thickening of the parietal pleura.
Conventional CT with contrast enhancement is also useful in detecting hematoma. The attenuation of blood, unlike that of other constituents of pleural effusions, is greater than that of water. This increase in attenuation in attributed to the density of the hemoglobin. 
The extrapleural hematoma result from malpositioned chest tubes, complications during placement of a catheter in the central vein, infection and other conditions of intercostal artery laceration. Patients with thickening of the parietal pleura may be at greater risk for extrapleural tube placement.

   On physical examination most patients show signs of right ventricular overload, but just as with pulmonary thromboembolism there may be relatively few respiratory findings. The condition differs from widespread, blood-borne metastases in that a metastasis represents tumor that has invaded the vessel wall and acquired its own blood supply. Tumor emboli are clumps of cells that are lodged within the lumen of the pulmonary vessels and have not yet invaded the vessel wall but are acting as obstructing emboli similar to thromboemboli. The patients are hypoxemic, have increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients, and have pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Conventional and high-resolution CT scan demonstrate: 1) a large heterogeous attenuated mass in the left lower lobe, 2) numerous discrete small nodules mainly in both upper lungs, prodominantly in centrilobular and subpleural location.

Pneumoconiosis with lung cancer was diagnosed based on history of exposure to coal dust for 30 years, radiologic findings, and fine-needle aspiration cytology for the mass in left lower lobe.","Lung cancer occurs slightly less frequently in coal miners than in comparable populations (1). Difficulties may arise in distinguishing bronchiogenic carcinoma from early PMF or, less frequently, Caplan's syndrome. In such situations, inspection of serial chest radiographs, which are usually available in coal workers, may be helpful. Carcinomas are generally better defined and more rapidly growing than early massive fibrosis. In such instances, CT may add additional diagnostic information (2). Topography of parenchymal abnormalities and analysis of associated lesions on CT represent important data in the differential diagnosis. Although conglomerations can be observed in all areas of the lungs, PMF is found mainly in the posterior segment of the upper lobes or in the superior segment of the lower lobes, usually on a background of simple pneumoconiosis. With a low suspicion of malignancy, a second CT study may be performed several weeks later, using a similar technical protocol to that initially performed, to detect any change in size that would strongly suggest carcinoma (2). Lung cancers frequently occurred with simple pneumoconiosis compared with complicated pneumoconiosis with massive fibrosis, a difference that was highly significant (33% versus 12%). The histology of the pneumoconiosis-related lung cancers showed  squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) (57%), adenocarcinomas (33%), small cell carcinomas (5%), large cell carcinomas (2%) (3). SCCs arising from patients with pneumoconiosis had a significantly higher frequency of the peripheral type than SCCs from patients without pneumoconiosis. Moreover, peripheral-type SCCs accounted for 43% of the pneumoconiosis-related lung cancers, which indicated an absolutely increased number of peripheral-type SCCs, as compared with those from patients without pneumoconiosis (43% versus 18%) (3).

The lesion may occur on the external surface of a bone or in soft tissue at a distance from the periosteal surface. The abnormal tissue is characterized by proliferation of fibrous tissue and by formation of large amounts of new bone. Cartilage may also be present.""(1)

  From an etiologic point of view, heterotopic soft-tissue ossification is divided into several categories :
1. An hereditary background with progressive, generalized evolution, such as fibrodysplasia (myositis) ossificans progressiva. (2)
2. Circumscribed lesions that can be related to different causes :
  a) Trauma as a causative factor(most common). Usually, repeated microtrauma is responsible.
  b) Organic diseases, such as poliomyelitis, tabes, syringomyelia, paraplegia, tetanus, hemophilia, etc. Often these entities produce MO by trauma resulting from passive exercises rather than the usual neuropathic factors. 
  c) Non-traumatic cases. Under intensive questioning, the patient cannot confirm a history of antecedent trauma.

  They appear usually in patients between 10 and 80 years of age ; most of them occur in the 3rd and 4th decades of life. Typical symptoms consist of focal pain with partial limitation of movement and a localized soft-tissue expansion that may be accompanied by fever, elevated sedimentation rate, and leukocytosis. For half the cases, the lesions are found in six specific anatomical sites : adjacent to the anterior superior iliac spine; at the superior lip of the acetabulum; at the greater trochanter; at the linea aspera in the midportion of the femur; at the mid-part of the humeral shaft; and in the area of the first and second metacarpals. 

  Histopathologically, the most prominent feature in the diagnosis of this entity is the recognition of the ""zone phenomenon"" described by Ackerman(3). It consists of a tumoral structuring in three areas, that reflects different degrees of cellular maturation: The central zone is composed of undifferentiated mesenchyma with high-grade mitotic activity : the intermediate zone in which there is a variable amount of osteoid intermingled with fibroblasts and osteoblasts; and the peripheral zone, in which the osteoid undergoes calcification and evolves into mature lamellar bone. The maturation period occurs between 1 and 7 weeks.

CT scans demonstrate multiple scattered nodules with tree-in-bud pattern. Some bronchi/bronchioles appear dilated and thickened. Also note mosaic attenuation of the lung. At this time, sputum examination did not reveal any infectious organism. Chest radiograph obtained 3 months later shows aggravation of the lung lesions, when acid-fast bacilli were identified from sputum exam.","On HRCT, pulmonary tuberculosis may show centrilobular distributed, small rounded areas of high attenuation, branched linear areas of high attenuation contiguous to the small rounded areas, dilated airways with thick walls, and decreased lung attenuation in the peripheral areas, mimicking DPB. In cases with such tuberculous bronchiolitis, centrilobular nodules and linear branching shadows are caused by peribronchiolar granulomatous inflammation. 

 There are two main theories concerning the development of tuberculous endobronchial lesion. One holds that the bronchial changes originate from the contact of the mucosa with the infected sputum from the lesions in the distal lung parenchyma, particularly those with cavities (1). This theory cannot explain the mechanism in patients who have few acid-fast bacilli in the sputum or have noncavitary parenchymal lesions as in our cases. The other more recent theory suggests a submucosal spread of tubercle bacilli through lymphatics to the peribronchial region from the lung parenchyma (2-4). A detailed postmortem study of endobronchitis by Myerson (3) showed evidence for retrograde passage of tubercle bacilli via lymphatics from the bronchioles and subsegmental bronchi to the main stem bronchus. Another possibility is the direct extension of the tuberculous process from an adjacent parenchymal lesion or tuberculous lymphadenitis (4).","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-298-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-298-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-298-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-298-4.jpg']",28,"['correct:19/28', 'semi:9/28']"

Contrast-enhanced CT scan shows fusiform dilation of the proximal left lower lobe pulmonary vein.
Varix of the central left inferior pulmonary vein was confirmed by operation.","In the literature a pulmonary vein varix has been described as a rare lesion consisting of a focal pathological enlargement of a segment of a pulmonary vein (1). Histologic sections of the varix suggest no intrinsic defect in the structure of the varix wall. Most patients with pulmonary varices are asymptomatic and come to medical attention due to the finding of a mass on chest roentgenogram. Complications associated with pulmonary varix include cerebral embolism unnecessary thoracotomy, and rupture of the varix into the pleural space or into a bronchus with hemoptysis. Pulmonary vein varices usually remain stable in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. Acute increase in varix size is indicative of elevation of left atrial pressure (2). The most common cardiac abnormality associated with pulmonary varix is acquired mitral valve disease, evident in one third of reported cases (3). Appropriate management involves mitral valve replacement rather than surgery of the varix itself. In case of hemoptysis in non-cardiac reason of the varix, lobe section can be necessary. An appropriate diagnosis of pulmonary vein varix should therefore be established to prevent unnecessary thoracotomy. Most pulmonary varices involve the right lower lobe pulmonary vein with the left upper lobe vein next in frequency. A pulmonary vein varix can be picked up on a routine chest radiography as a low-density, non-calcified opacity with well-defined edges. It can simulate a malignant lung tumor, or a mediastinal or paramediastinal mass.  Definitive diagnosis rests on the demonstration of the following features on pulmonary angiography: normal pulmonary arteries without shunting; normal filling of the veins feeding the varix; delayed but direct drainage of the varix into the left atrium; and limitation of the varicosity to the proximal portion of the vein. Because of less invasive nature of CT, dynamic bolus CT or single-slice helical CT could be good alternative diagnositic tools. The CT finding of pulmonary vein varix is dilated pulmonary vein opacifying simultaneously with the left atrium (4). The disadvantage of the CT technique is that only a part of the lung can be imaged during optimal contrast enhancement in one single breath hold. The newly introduced multi-slice helical CT makes it possible to examine the entire lung with thin slices during optimal enhancement in a single breath hold, allowing better depiction of the pulmonary vascular tree (2).

Unenhanced CT scan shows peripheral calcification in the subpleural nodule and small amount of left pleural effusion. Contrast-enhanced CT scan shows strong vascular enhancement of the nodular lesion.","Rasmussen's aneurysm is a rare phenomenon caused by weakening of the pulmonary artery wall from adjacent cavitary tuberculosis. A review of autopsy findings in patients with a history of chronic cavitary tuberculosis showed a 5% prevalence of Rasmussen's aneurysm. A destructive lung process, irrespective of its pathogenesis, can destroy adjacent lung, weaken the arterial wall, or erode any vessel in its vicinity. Progressive weakening of the arterial wall occurs as granulation tissue replaces both the adventitia and the media. The granulation tissue in the vessel wall is then gradually replaced by fibrin, resulting in thinning of the arterial wall, pseudoaneurysm formation, and subsequent rupture. Rasmussen's aneurysm involves the small to medium pulmonary artery branches that develops in the vicinity of a tuberculous cavity and usually distributed peripherally and beyond the branches of main pulmonary arteries. Hemoptysis is the usual presenting symptom and may be life-threatening when it is massive. There is the potential risk of aneurysmal rupture during diagnostic catheter angiography.

(lung, cervix, head and neck ca, esophagus, etc), inflammation (invasive aspergillosis, invasive mucormycosis, nocardiosis, cryptococcosis), Wegener’s granulomatosis, septic or aspetic emboli. 
 Chest CT scans show diffuse, peribronchial consolidation in the medial aspects of right upper and lower lung fields. Necrotic material is noted in the dependent portion of the largest cavity of the right lower lobe. The wall of the cavities are slightly ragged or spiculated with surrounding halos in some nodules. Capsules of the nodules are enhanced as rim pattern. 
 Tissues were obtained by CT-guided, core needle biopsy. Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured. Pathologic specimen show fungal organisms (aspergillus) and coagulation necrosis (probably, infectious origin) without the evidence of tumor cells. ","Cavitating aspergillosis infection has been documented in immunosuppressed patient with cancer (1, 2). Underlying malignancies included leukemia, lymphoma, and metastatic carcinoma (lung ca, breast ca, colon ca). Patients received the following immunosuppressed therapy: chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy plus corticosteroids, corticosteroid alone, and steroids plus localized radiation (one of eleven patients). 
 Lung cavitation occurs in 4% to 16% of patients with invasive aspergillosis. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is defined histologically by parenchymal and blood vessel invasion by fungal hyphae with ensuing thrombosis, infarction, and acute inflammation. Cavities occur most frequently by separation of the infarcted lung from adjacent viable lung, resulting in as intracavitary sequestrum of necrotic lung tissue. The roentgenologic correlation of this sequence of events is the “air-crescent” sign. The proposed pathogenesis of cavity formation invokes proteolytic destruction of lung parenchyma by enzymes released from neutrophils at the periphery of the infarct. The mechanism is supported by the study of Albelda et al. (3), who documented that cavitation appeared coincident with recovery from granulocytopenia. Fungal invasion, acute inflammation, and necrosis of blood vessels adjacent to developing cavities can result in arterial fistulae and massive hemoptysis. Massive fatal hemoptysis is clearly associated with lung cavitation in invasive aspergillosis (2). There was a relatively good correlation between the clincal duration of pulmonary disease and the histologic maturity of cavities. As cavities age they progress through a stage of granulation tissue to dense mural fibrosis. This process is accompanied by organizing pneumonia in the adjacent lung. One of histologic pattern of cavitary aspergillosis was that of a suppurative, granulomatous pneumonia with abscess formation, similar to lesions seen in chronic bacterial or fungal infections, such as actinomycosis or cryptococcosis. Suppurative, granulomatous aspergillosis has been described in patients with chronic granulomatous disease of childhood. Suppurative aspergillus pneumonia also has been reported rarely in patients with antecedent viral or bacterial infection or general debilitation or as a localized or disseminated form of invasive aspergillosis. Of particular interest was the ability of CT-guided TBNA to assist in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis in small peripheral inflammatory lesions in severely immunocompromised patients (4).

CT scan (lung window settings) obtained at the level of lung bases shows dilated peripheral pulmonary vessels and an abnormally large number of visible terminal vessel branches.
  The presence of right-to-left shunt was confirmed by contrast echocardiography.","Hepatopulmonary syndrome is characterized by the triad of chronic liver disease, increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient on room air (hypoxemia), and evidence of intrapulmonary vascular dilation.  The most consistent structural abnormality found in HPS is marked dilation (up to 500 mm) of precapillary vessels in the lung and pleura.  The mechanism for this dilation is unknown. When small vessels are dilated, the diffusion of oxygen to the centers of the vessels is insufficient, and erythrocytes flowing down the center do not get fully oxygenated, resulting in a right to left shunt. The deficiency of oxygenation is further exacerbated by the hyperdynamic circulation, which decreases transit time.  The presence of intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt can be demonstrated by contrast echocardiography or 99mTc macroaggregated albumin (MAA) lung scanning.  The rationale for both diagnostic modalities in HPS is that the microbubbles (at least 15 mm) used for contrast echocardiography or the aggregated albumin (20-60 mm) for 99mTcMAA lung scanning can pass through dilated, but not normal, pulmonary capillaries (less than 8 mm in diameter).
  On chest radiographs, intrapulmonary vascular dilation of HPS may manifest as small nodular or reticulonodular opacities, predominantly in the bases.  The frequency of these findings is 46% to 100% of cases.  The CT feature of HPS is dilation of peripheral lung vessels with many extending to the pleura. Thick scans depict this vascular abnormality better than thin-section (high-resolution) scans. There are two patterns of vascular abnormality on pulmonary angiography in HPS.

Seven days later, the areas of ground-glass attenuations are changed into consolidations. Associated pneumomediastinum is also seen. Six months later, the areas of consolidations retracted and changed into fibrotic linear opacity with bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasia on follow-up HRCT.","  Paraquat (1,1’-dimethyl-4,4’-bipyridylium dichloride) is a widely used herbicide that has toxic effects on the lung, liver and kidneys. Death from paraquat poisoning was primarily caused by progressive pulmonary damage with respiratory failure (1). The toxic effects of paraquat are through to result from oxygen radicals that destroy the cell membrane (2). Organ damage by paraquat depends on the balance between oxygen radicals and tissue levels of oxygen and antioxidants. Organ-specific damage to the lung is caused by both lower concentration of the antioxidants and higher concentration of oxygen within the lung. Early pathologic finding in the lung include thickening of the alveolar walls by edema, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cells. Some of the alveoli fill with fluid and large amount of fibrin (3). Late pathologic findings include pulmonary fibrosis and microcysts (2).
  According to Im et al (4), there were three patterns of pulmonary abnormalities seen on the chest radiographs: a) diffuse air-space consolidation, b) diffuse cystic and linear shadows and c) focal interstitial opacities containing small cysts. During the first 7 days after ingestion, the preponderant radiologic abnormality was diffuse consolidation. Cystic (2-9mm) and linear opacities then appeared within the consolidated lung during the next 7 days, and this pattern was the preponderant finding after 2 weeks. Beyond 1 month, a focal honeycombing of the lung was the principal abnormality. Meanwhile, according to Lee et al (5), the predominant finding within the first 7 days was areas of ground-glass attenuation. The initial areas of ground-glass attenuation changed into areas of consolidation associated with bronchiectasis and areas of irregular lines. The initial areas of consolidation became more highly attenuated with bronchiectasis or areas of irregular lines on follow-up CT scans.

HRCT scans show extensive air-space consolidation and ground glass attenuation. In addition, reticular pattern is apparent, presumably representing thickening of the interlobular septa, showing a typical crazy paving appearance. A more dense consolidation with air-bronchogram is noted in the right lower lobe.
  Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was confirmed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sputum AFB stain.","  Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a disease characterized by filling of the alveolar spaces with a periodic acid-Shiff-positive proteinaceous material, rich in lipid (1). The pathogenesis of this disease is poorly understood, and the majority of cases are considered to be idiopathic. Some cases result from exposure to dusts (particularly silica) or from immunologic disturbances due to immunodeficiency, leukemia, lymphoma, or chemotherapy. PAP occurs four times as frequently in men as in women (2). Patients range in age from a few months to more than 70 years, with two-thirds of patients being between 30 and 50 years old.
  The typical radiograph shows a bilateral patchy, diffuse, or perihilar ill-defined nodular or confluent airspace pattern, which is usually most severe in the lung bases. HRCT findings include bilateral areas of ground-glass opacity, smooth interlobular septal thickening in lung regions showing ground-glass opacity (i.e., crazy-paving), consolidation and a patchy or geographic distribution. The thickened interlobular septa were present within area of consolidation, and were shown on open-lung biopsy to reflect septal edema. Interstitial abnormalities characterized by the presence of alveolar wall infiltration by lymphocytes and macrophages, and interstitial edema. These findings probably reflect interstitial inflammation (3). Septal thickening can also represent interstitial accumulation of the proteinaceous material. It should be emphasized that in patients with alveolar proteinosis, septal thickening is usually visible only in regions of ground-glass opacity.
  CT can demonstrate a focal pneumonia in patients who have PAP that is not apparent on plain radiograph. Superimposed infection, often by Nocardia asteroides is a common complication of alveolar proteinosis. By detecting focal areas of dense consolidation or abscess formation, CT may confirm a clinical suspicion of superimposed infection. In early studies, infection with Nocardia was reported in as many as 8% of patients who had alveolar proteinosis (4). In is now less common, presumably owing to the use of BAL in treatment of affected patients (1). More recently, some authors have noted an association of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and Pneumocystis carinii infection (1).","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-245-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-245-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-245-3.jpg']",22,"['correct:5/22', 'semi:13/22']"

CT scan shows round homogenous low density mass located at posterior aspect of left main pulmonary artery. The mass is slightly indented by left main pulmonary artery. The mass is not enhanced at all after administration of contrast media. 
  Pathologic examination for the excised wall of the cystic mass revealed bronchogenic cyst.","Bronchogenic cysts are congenital lesions thought to result from abnormal budding of the embryonic foregut that occurs between the 26th and 40th days of gestation (1). Bronchogenic cysts are sometimes found in association with other congenital pulmonary malformation such as sequestration and lobar emphysema (2). Most bronchogenic cysts occurred in a characteristic location such as the subcarinal or paratracheal region. Less commonly, cysts may occur within the lung parenchyma, pleura, or diaphragm.
  At computed tomography, bronchogenic cysts typically manifest as a spherical masses of either water or soft tissue attenuation. Findings on MR images parallel those on CT scans, and may include cystic components mixed with other tissue types. MR images of bronchogenic cysts have been reported to show signal similar to that of muscle on T1-weighted images, with a hyperintense to CSF on T2-weighted images. This finding suggests that mucus and proteinaceous debries within the cyst is the most likely explanation for the increased attenuation seen on CT scans (3).
  McAdams et al. reported that following imaging features maybe helpful for differentiating non-water attenuation bronchogenic cysts from solid masses (4). First, the presence of a well-defined, thin, smooth wall suggests that the lesion is a cyst. Second, bronchogenic cysts with high CT attenuation numbers are usually of homogeneous attenuation and have cyst contents that do not enhance following administration of contrast material. Third, MR imaging can be very useful for differentiating high-attenuating cysts on CT scans from soft-tissue mass. Such cysts are typically isointense or hyperintense to CSF with all pulse sequences.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-362-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-362-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-362-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-362-4.jpg']",24,['correct:23/24']

The etiology of AEP is unknown. It has been suggested that it may represent acute hypersensitivity to an inhaled antigen. It is pathologically characterized by infiltration of eosinophils and mononuclear cells and edema within alveoli, bronchial walls, and to a lesser degree the interstitial space and pleura. Following diagnostic criteria of AEP were suggested by Allen et al. : (a) acute febrile illness of less than 5 days’ duration, (b) hypoxemic respiratory failure, (c) diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, (d) increased eosinophil counts in BAL fluid more than 25%, (e) no history of other infectious or atopic illness, (f) prompt and complete response to steroid therapy without relapse on withdrawl, (g) absence of parasitic, fungal, and other infection.

Microscopic polyangiitis is a more appropriate name than microscopic polyarteritis because some patients have no evidence for arterial involvement. The absence or paucity of immunoglobulin localization in vessel walls distinguishes microscopic polyangiitis from immune complex mediated small vessel vasculitis, such as Henoch-Schonlein purpura and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. Clinical, epidemiological, and pathologic differences warrant the separation of microscopic polyangiitis from polyarteritis nodosa on the basis of involvement of capillaries and venules, positive myeloperoxydase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (P-ANCA) (70-93%), and an active urine sediment by the former but not the latter. Pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis, and hemorrhagic pulmonary capillaritis are common in patients with microscopic polyangiitis. Microscopic polyangiitis is the most common cause for pulmonary-renal vasculitic syndrome. The vasculitis in patients with microscopic polyangiitis is pathologically indistinguishable from the vasculitis of Wegener's granulomatosis and Churg-Strauss syndrome. Granulomatous inflammation distinguishes Wegener's granulomatosis from microscopic polyangiitis. Asthma and eosinophilia distinguish Churg-Strauss syndrome from microscopic polyangiitis. Microscopic polyangiitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome are all associated with circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies.
  Clinical manifestations are highly polymorphic, but rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is one of the most frequent and most severe manifestations of the disease. Other systemic findings include pulmonary hemorrhage (12-29%), musculoskeletal involvement (65-72%), purpura (44-58%), abdominal pain (32-58%), digestive tract bleeding (29%), peripheral neuropathy (14036%), and ocular, ear, nose and throat lesions.
  Biopsy of an affected organ and detection of circulating anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) are key elements for the positive diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis. Biopsies can disclose necrotizing vasculitis affecting small vessels, without granulomas and without immune deposits. 
  Treatment of severe forms of microscopic polyangiitis is based on the administration of pulse methylprednisolone, oral corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. Treatment induces a complete remission of the disease in more than 90% of cases, but about 30% of the patients will experience a relapse, and progressive worsening of renal function can occur in patients with severe chronic renal failure.

The lateral projection shows that the mass is situated in the middle mediastinal compartments. The tracheal air column is displaced anteriorly.
 CT scan at the level of the aortopulmonary window shows that the mass is of water density and has a sharp interface with contiguous lung parenchyma.","   Mediastinal lymphangioma have two clinicopathologic forms; 1) a variety that extends from the neck into the mediastinum and usually occurs in infants (cystic hygroma) and 2) a more or less well-circumscribed variety that usually is discovered in adults and is located in the lower anterior (occasionally middle posterior) mediastinum remote from the neck. As with hemangiomas, lymphangiomas probably represent developmental anomalies rather than true neoplasm. Pathologically, the tumor consists of thin-walled, usually multilocular cysts containing numerous thin-walled vascular spaces lined by endothelial cells. The wall is composed of connective tissue with a variable amount of lymphoid tissue.
 The radiographic findings are nonspecific and consist of a sharply defined, smoothly marginated mediastinal mass, which frequently displaces adjacent mediastinal structures.

A cystic nodule in also seen in right upper lobe. 
  The patient has a history of laryngeal papilloma. Final diagnosis was made by tracheal biopsy.","A papilloma can be defined as a branching of coarsely lobulated tumor composed of epithelium-lined fibrovascular stalks arising from and projecting above and epithelial surface.
  Squamous papillomas are the most common laryngeal tumors in children between 18 month and 3 years of age and are frequently multiple, a condition referred to as juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis, and usually limited to the larynx. Distal dissemination to the trachea, bronchi, and lung parenchyma occurs almost exclusively in patients with known laryngeal lesions, although quite rare, distal disease in the absence of laryngeal lesions is more common in adults than in children(1). Tracheal or proximal bronchial involvement occurs in only 5% of patients; 2% of all patients with laryngeal papillomatosis will eventually develop bronchial involvement. It typically occurs in children with juvenile papillomas, in whom a tracheotomy has been performed(2). The mechanism of dissemination is generally considered to be due to either aspiration of infectious fragments, which serve to establish new foci of tumor, or multicentric viral infection; both probably play a role(3).
  Hoarseness is the most common initial symptom due to the laryngeal lesions. With dissemination, airway obstruction can result in wheezing, atelectasis, and recurrent pneumonia. Hemoptysis occurs frequently, and the clinical picture can resemble that of active tuberculosis or asthma(3).
  Grossly, papillomas are polypoid or sessile masses within the airways. Distal papillomas, which begin to grow in the respiratory and terminal bronchioles, are composed of sheets of squamous cells that eventually proliferate within the alveoli and parasitize the pulmonary capillary bed as a blood supply. Central necrosis and/or communication of these nodular lesions with local airways can lead to cavitation. Cellular atypia is common in the parenchymal papillomas, and transformation to locally invasive squamous cell carcinoma is well known in the patients, and the risk of this malignancy increases with the duration of disease(4).
  CT scans show small nodules or nodular thickenings, occasionally carpeting part or the entire trachea. Bronchial involvement has similar findings(3,5). Involvement of distal airway results in multiple nodular opacity frequently associated with cavitation. Since papillomas disseminate via the airways, a centrillobular distribution of opacities or small nodules would be expected. Cavitation is frequent and superficially resembles cystic bronchiectasis, although CT studies reveal absence of dilatation of airways leading to the cavity. The wall of the cavities typically shows a smooth surface and uniform thickness(3,4). 
  Although papillomas often regress at puberty or are successfully treated by surgical excision in children with isolated laryngeal disease, distal lesions do not tend to improve spontaneously.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-96-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-96-2.jpg']",29,"['correct:21/29', 'semi:5/29']"

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is the second most common histologic type of tracheal malignancy (most common: squamous cell carcinoma, 3rd common: mucoepidermoid, and 10% of sarcoma, lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, plasmacytoma, small cell carcinoma, and metastases). Tracheal ACC is an indolent tumor that affects people at any age but has a peak incidence in the fifth decade. There is a nearly equal male-to-female ratio. Almost half of tracheal ACCs occur in the proximal trachea, accounting for the most common presenting symptoms: dyspnea, cough, and hoarseness.[1]
  Until recently, adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) has been considered to be a borderline disease between benign and malignant because of its low level of malignancy, slow growth and scarce aggressiveness. ACC is now a histologically well defined tumor and is currently classified as malignant; it has a prolonged natural history, is infiltrative, and tends to recur locally and give rise to local-regional metastases or, more rarely, remote metastases.[2]
  Takahashi[3] report a 33-year-old woman with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the trachea was treated by resection of the upper and mid-trachea, plus total laryngectomy, subtotal thyroidectomy, partial resection of the cervical esophageal muscle layer and mediastinal tracheostomy. This tumor invaded directly into the thyroid gland, the larynx, the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the cervical esophagus. Three years after the operation, metastases developed in the right lung (S10, S2) and partial resection of the lung was performed. This patient is now free from disease. Aggressive surgical resection is important for the improvement of survival in this condition, although this tumor shows low grade malignancy and is slowly growing.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-97-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-97-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-97-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-97-4.jpg']",19,"['correct:8/19', 'semi:4/19']"

Reflux of a contrast material into the hepatic vein with the dilation of the inferior vena cava is noted. ,"Constrictive pericarditis is an uncommon but potentially curable condition by pericardiectomy and characterized by fibrous or calcific constrictive thickening of the pericardium, which prevents normal diastolic filling of the heart. Constrictive pericarditis may follow any type of pericardial effusion and may develop within two or three months of the effusion, or it may take years to develop. The etiology of pericardial thickening includes M. tuberculosis, idiopathic, non-tuberculous infectious condition, post-radiotherapy, local invasion by malignancy, post-cardiac surgery, post pericardiectomy and sarcoidosis (1). The clinical presentation of constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy is similar. CT scan has shown a value in differentiating these two condition. Normal pericardial thickness virtually rules out constrictive pericarditis. CT findings in constrictive pericarditis include pericardial thickening (above 3mm), narrowing and tubular deformity of the right ventricle, normal or small ventricular size and straightening of the interventricular septum (2). Irregular calcification may be anywhere over the surface of the heart but is particularly present in regions of the heart where the normal fat is abundant in the artioventricular groove (3). Systemic vein dilatation, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites and occasionally pleural effusion are secondary findings. Reflux of a contrast material into the coronary sinus and hepatic vein may occur following bolus administration of a contrast medium during CT scanning.

  The diagnosis of Castleman’s disease, plasma cell type was made by biopsy of left inguinal lymph node. ","   Castleman’s disease, also known as angiofollicular hyperplasia or giant lymph node hyperplasia, is an uncommon benign lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles. On the basis of histologic criteria, it has been divided into two types: hyaline vascular and plasma cell. The hyaline vascular type is characterized by hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles with germinal center formation and the presence of numerous capillaries with hyalinized walls. This type accounts for approximately 90% of cases and usually manifests as a solitary perihilar or mediastinal mass in asymptomatic patients. The plasma cell type is characterized by the presence of  relatively few capillaries as well as the presence of mature plasma cells between the hyperplastic germinal centers. Although in the majority of Castleman’s disease, it is usually localized, a multicentric form has been recognized clinically and histologically. It affects individuals of all ages, but the peak incidence is in the fifth decade of life. Female patients are more commonly affected than male by a ratio of 2:1. Most patients presents with systemic complaints of fever, weight loss and anemia. The enlarged lymph nodes seen in the plasma cell type shows relatively low level of enhancement after an injection of contrast material than in the hyaline vascular type. Histologic findings obtained from lung biopsy in patients who had multicentric Castleman’s disease have been shown lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis(LIP). CT findings of LIP include ground-glass attenuation, air-space consolidation, ill-defined nodules, extensive thickening of bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septa, and cysts. The majority of multicentric Castleman’s disease was the plasma cell type, and those who affected by multicentric type typically had a much worse prognosis than those with localized Castleman’s disease.

Although sequestrations may appear solid on plain radiographs, CT usually shows an irregular cystic component to the lesion. The demonstration of a systemic artery supplying the lesion is the critical diagnostic feature. Aortography is particularly important if surgical treatment is being considered because inadvertent damage to the artery during surgery can cause significant hemorrhage. The systemic artery can also be demonstrated by CT using intravenous contrast enhancement or occasionally by Doppler ultrasound. The presence of absence of a systemic arterial supply is the critical feature in the differential diagnosis from bronchogenic cysts. The infected pulmonary sequestration may contain fluid levels and have an ill-defined edge because of inflammatory changes in adjacent lung.

Direct contiguous involvement from adjacent tuberculous lymphadenitis is known to be the most frequent cause of esophageal tuberculosis (2-3). As the tuberculous process involves mediastinal lymph nodes, they enlarge because of caseation necrosis and granulation tissue. Necrotic material within the tuberculous mediastinal lymph node can be extruded through an esophageal and/or tracheoesophageal fistula, resulting in a localized gaseous collection within the mediastinum. 
   The most common sites of involvement in tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenitis are the right paratracheal, tracheobronchial and subcarinal areas (4-6). However, according to Lim at al (7), the most common site of esophagomediastinal fistula located in the subcarinal area. Preferential involvement occurs mainly because of the anatomic proximity of the esophagus to diseased nodes. Even though tuberculous lymphadenitis involves the right paratracheal nodes more commonly than the subcarinal nodes, as the diseased right paratracheal nodes have less chance to contact the esophagus directly than the subcarinal nodes, fistulous communication is more prone to occur in the subcarinal area.
   Acquired benign bronchoesophageal fistulas in the adult usually occur by granulomatous infection, most commonly tuberculosis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the pathogenesis of inflammatory bronchoesophageal or tracheoesophageal fistula: 1) Caseonecrotic parabronchial enlarged nodes may rupture into the esophagus and the trachea; 2) primary tracheal ulcers may erode into adjacent esophagus; or 3) infection may give rise to adhesions between tracheobronchial lymph nodes and the neighboring esophagus with subsequent development of a traction diverticulum.

","Pulmonary mucormycosis is relatively rare, often fatal, opportunistic infection caused by fungi of the class Zygomycetes, order Mucorales. The main risk factors are diabetes mellitus, hematologic malignancy, renal insufficiency, and organ transplantation. The most common radiologic manifestation of pulmonary mucormycosis is progressive, homogeneous, lobar or multilobar consolidation without lobar predilection. Pathologically, consolidation represents confluent pneumonia or pulmonary infarction and hemorrhage from large vessel thrombosis. Less commonly, one or multiple nodules or masses may predominate. Cavitation or abscess formation can be seen. Occasionally there may be pleural effusion or hilar lymphadenopathy. CT findings include focal or diffuse areas of low attenuation within consolidation and the halo sign, representing hemorrhage caused by vascular invasion. Although the presence of organisms in a culture from the respiratory tract is suggestive, definite diagnosis requires histologic demonstration of the organism in affected tissue.

The esophageal wall is thickened. Pneumonic consolidation is noted in right upper lobe. Pleural effusion is associated. HRCT scan shows fibrotic consolidation with traction bronchiectasis in paramediastinal portions of both upper lobe, indicating radiation fibrosis.","Malignant fistula between the esophagus and the respiratory tract or the mediastinum is a serious complication of esophageal carcinoma. Bronchopneumonia and sepsis usually are the terminal events. Because the esophagus lacks a serosa and is attached to neighboring structures by only a loose adventitia, there is no anatomic barrier to prevent spread of tumor into the adjacent mediastinum. Therefore, esophageal cancer has a marked tendency to invade contiguous structures in the neck or chest, such as the thyroid, larynx, trachea, bronchi, aorta, thoracic duct, lung, pericardium, and diaphragm. The tracheobronchial tree is a particularly common site of involvement; tracheoesophageal or esophagobronchial fistulas develop in 5 to 10% of all patients with esophageal cancer. 
    Increased morbidity or mortality may also be attributed directly to complications of treatment (e.g., radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy) such as esophageal ulceration, perforation, and fistula formation. Involvement of the respiratory tract without fistulae often leads to fistula formation during treatment due to the necrosis of the tumor or natural progression of the disease. Approximately 10-20% of esophageal carcinoma patients develop a fistula after radiation. However, there is no evidence that radiation increases the incidence of fistula formation. It also is difficult to distinguish whether the development of fistula during CRT is due to an adverse event or natural tumor invasion.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-366-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-366-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-366-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-366-4.jpg']",16,['correct:14/16']

HRCT scans show multiple cavitary nodules and air-containing cysts with variable thickness of smooth wall in both upper and mid-lung zone, sparing both lower lung zones. Diagnosis of Histiocytosis-X was made by open lung biopsy.","The pathogenesis of the pulmonary lesions of histiocytosis X (HX) is poorly understood. HX exhibited cysts scattered throughout the lung parenchyma. In almost all patients, HRCT demonstrates cystic air spaces, which are usually less than 10 mm in diameter; these cysts are characteristic of HX. On HRCT, the lung cysts have walls that range from being barely perceptible to being several millimeters in thickness. The presence of distinct walls allows differentiation of these cysts from areas of emphysema. Although many cysts appear round, they can also have bizarre shapes, being bilobed, clover-leaf shaped, or branching in appearance. Confluent or conjoined cysts with persisting septations are seen in more than two thirds of patients. HRCT findings closely mirror the gross pathologic appearances of this disease. The cysts were lined with fibrous tissue, which interrupted focally by a diverse population of inflammatory cells and histiocytes. Interstitial cellular infiltration is associated with destruction and retraction of the lung parenchyma, which appeared to result in the formation of new cystic spaces. The Langerhans' histiocyte may play a role in the production of fibrous tissue in the early formation of cyst walls. The mechanism of cystic changes is uncertain. Patterns of the nodules or cysts may represent longevity of the lesions. Early stage of the disease is characterized by the abundance of nodules and cavitated nodules, whereas cysts are few and do not tend to be confluent. Advanced disease is characterized by a small number of nodules, whereas cysts have increased in number and size and are confluent. The following sequence of abnormalities seen with CT corresponds to the evolution of the disease: nodules, cavitated nodules, thick-walled cysts, cysts, and confluent cysts, rupture or collapse of cysts with or without pneumothorax.

   Cryptococcal infection can develop in both immunocompetent & immunocompromised hosts, but it may result in severe, disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients. Approximately one third of patients are asymptomatic, whereas the rest symptoms range from mild cough and low grade fever to acute, febrile, life-threatening condition, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome in compromised hosts.

  On Fiberoptic bronchoscopy, smooth multifocal luminal narrowing of bronchi and black anthracotic pigmentation in bronchial mucosa were found (A-view from right upper lobar bronchus; B-view from bronchus intermedius; C-obstructed right middle lobar bronchus with mucosal thickening). This patient had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis in his young age. ","   Anthracofibrosis is a bronchoscopic finding showing dark anthracotic pigmentation on the bronchial mucosa in conjunction with bronchial narrowing or obliteration (1). Most patients are elderly women who usually present with cough, sputum, and dyspnea. Because of their age and segmental or lobar atelectasis on chest radiographs, bronchoscopy and chest CT are usually performed to exclude bronchogenic carcinoma. On CT, a segmental collapse distal to involved bronchi is the most common finding. The right middle lobe is the most frequently involved lobe. Bronchial narrowing is commonly accompanied by thickening of the wall. Enlarged or calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes adjacent to the involved bronchi are frequently noted (2).
   Establishing the origin of anthracotic pigments and the cause for bronchial stenosis is difficult. Previously, dark anthracotic pigmentation in the bronchial mucosa has been regarded as bronchoscopic findings of pneumoconiosis or evidence of heavy exposure to atmospheric soot particles (3). Recent investigators propose that bronchial tuberculosis is one of the most likely causes for the development of bronchial anthracofibrosis. Several evidences supporting this opinion are the association of either active or old pulmonary tuberculosis with anthracofibrosis, the reported cases with development of the anthracotic pigmentation during the course of antituberculous chemotherapy, and similar CT findings between bronchial tuberculosis and anthracofibrosis (1,2,4).
   The hypothesis about the development of bronchial anthracofibrosis is as follows. Perforation of a tuberculous lymph node into the bronchus may develop insidiously, and the healing process may appear without apparent clinical symptoms in the aged population. The black pigments in the bronchial wall might be derived from anthracotic material in the adjacent lymph nodes, which might subsequently be incorporated into the scarred area of the bronchus. The involved lymph nodes, however, may perforate into the adjacent bronchi, and carbon particles in the lymph nodes may penetrate through the bronchial wall as deep as the mucosa, resulting in coloring of the bronchial mucosa. Subsequently, healing with fibrotic response may occur in the bronchi, resulting in bronchial narrowing or obstruction with anthracitic pigmentation (1).

No pleural effusion, mediastinal fluid or mediastinal free air is present. Esophagogram was normal (not shown).","There are three different types of acute esophageal trauma: Boerhaave’s syndrome, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, and submucosal dissection of the esophagus. The last one, which is rare, was first described in 1968 by Marks and Keet. There are several different terminologies for this condition: intramural rupture, esophageal apoplexy, submucosal or intramural dissection, and intramural hematoma. It usually occurs spontaneously with or without mucosal laceration, hence the term spontaneous submucosal dissection of the esophagus. However, not all cases of this condition occurs spontaneously. For instance, this rare disease may complicate mycobacterial infection in patients at risk for AIDS or endoscopic injection sclerotherapy. No report was available concerning cases caused by gastrofiberscopy.
   The most common presenting symptom is severe chest pain. As in Mallory-Weiss syndrome, treatment is conservative and the prognosis is excellent. However, Jung and Lee recently proposed close follow-up for an extensive dissection.
   The “mucosal stripe sign” had been suggested as a radiologic finding as early as in 1969. Reported esophagographic findings include a long, smooth filling defect in the mid- and lower esophagus on the poseterior wall and ""double-barreled"" esophagus. CT can show eccentric thickening of the esophageal wall, double lumens formed by mucosal flaps, low or high attenuation intramural hematoma, or walled-off paraesophageal low density.

CT scan shows a homogeneously enhanced round mass, which is completely confined within endobronchial lumen and hyperinflation of left lung probably due to air trapping by check valve mechanism.","Endobronchial and endotracheal leiomyosarcomas are encountered uncommonly. Endobronchial leiomyomas are somewhat more common than endobronchial leiomyosarcoma; approximately 30 were reviewed in one series in 1983, and 85 cases had been reported by 1995. Multiple leiomyomas have been reported but are either hamartomas or metastases from uterine myomas.
     Pathologically, bronchial tumors are typically located in the main or lobar airways. They are fleshy, are often pedunculated, and more or less completely fill the airway lumen; extension into the underlying tracheobronchial wall is unusual, even in the histologically malignant forms.
     Radiographic findings consist of atelectasis and obstructive pneumonitis. Nonobstructive tumors present as sessile or pedunculated soft tissue nodules within the trachea or bronchi. In a review of the literature concerning leiomyomas, the mean age at the time of diagnosis was 39 years. As might be expected, the majority of patients have cough, hemoptysis, or dyspnea. Provided that the tumors can be adequately excised, the prognosis is good even in histologically malignant forms; both local recurrence and metastases are exceptional. Some of these cases were treated by pneumonectomy or lobectomy. However, pure endobronchial lesion were treated by sleeve operation.

Pulmonary vessels appears to be larger in number and size in high-attenuation areas than low-attenuation areas, suggesting that low-attenuation areas are abnormal. Thin-section CT scans (collimation,1 mm) obtained at full expiration in a prone position show low attenuation areas are persistent, suggesting the parenchymal low attenuation is due to airway abnormality, rather than vascular abnormality. The diagnosis was made clinically without biopsy.","Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) or constrictive bronchiolitis is characterized by airflow limitation due to submucosal and peribronchiolar inflammation and fibrosis, primarily involving respiratory bronchioles in the absence of diffuse parenchymal inflammation. Pulmonary involvement is characteristically patchy and the diagnosis may be difficult to establish even following open lung biopsy. Several cases of bronchiolitis obliterans similar to that seen in rheumatoid disease have been described in patients with SLE(1,2). Affected patients have airflow obstruction on lung function testing and no parenchymal change on chest radiograph (2). In some patients, mild hyperinflation or subtle peripheral attenuation of the vascular marking may be seen (3). The most obvious HRCT findings are that of focal, often sharply defined, areas of decreased lung attenuation associated with vessels of decreased caliber. This change represents a combination of air trapping and oligemia, typically occurring in the absence of parenchymal consolidation (4). Bronchiectasis, mainly at a subsegmental level, may be noted. In addition, expiratory CT shows focal areas of air trapping consistent with small airway obstruction (2). Rarely, centrilobular branching opacities or ill-defined centrilobular opacities may be predominant finding. Ill-defined centrilobular opacities may suggest active, cellular stage of bronchiolar inflammation.

H. influenza and S. aureus were isolated on sputum culture.","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary disease of autosomal recessive transmission.   The basic abnormality consists of abnormal secretions from variable exocrine glands including the salivary, sweat glands, pancreas (90%), large bowel and tracheobronchial tree.

As a result of improved medical care, life expectancy has increased.  Whereas the survival rate older than 17 years used to be about 5 % by the 1970s, for infants born today in the UK, the predicted mean life expectancy is 40 years.

Pulmonary NTMB disease is increasing in prevalence and is most commonly caused by Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare or M kansasii. Occasionally, M xenopi, M fortuitum, or M chelonae also causes pulmonary disease.

Pulmonary NTMB infection has five distinct clinicoradiologic manifestations: (a) classic infection, (b) nonclassic infection, (c) nodules in asymptomatic patients, (d) infection in patients with achalasia, and (e) infection in immunocompromised patients. Although classic NTMB infection may be indistinguishable from active tuberculosis, it is usually more indolent.

Symptoms, and signs (dyspnea, hemoptysis and cough), radiographic manifestations (diffuse bilateral infiltrate), and the clinical course were most severe 2-10 days after TOCE. Two to 4 days after IV injection of the oil in rabbits, hypoxemia was most severe and was accompanied by extensive alveolar and interstitial inflammation, hemorrhage, and edema. The most likely mechanism by which iodized edema is the chemical injury due to its component fatty acids.

The tumors are categorized according to the size of their vascular spaces as capillary, cavernous, or venous hemangiomas. True hemangiomas are always benign, but histologic examination must be performed to differentiate them from potentially malignant vascular tumors such as hemangioendotheliomas and hemangiopericytomas.

   The diagnosis of cryptococcal pneumonia was made by transthoracic needle aspiration.","Cryptococcosis neoformans is a ubiquitous fungus found worldwide, particularly in soil contaminated by pigeon droppings. It is a thin-walled nonmycelial budding yeast that is characterized by a thick polysaccharide capsule best seen on India ink preparations. Cryptococcal infection usually results from inhalation of organisms. The spectrum of pulmonary cryptococcosis depends on host defences. In the immunocompetent, cryptococcal infections are commonly localized in the lung and patients are asymtomatic; whereas, in the immunocompromised, cryptococal infections often cause symptomatic pulmonary infections and often disseminate to the central nervous system, skin, and bones.
    Radiographically, the described pulmonary findings of cryptococcosis are diverse but most commonly include single or multiple nodular nodules and segmental or lobar consolidation. Additional features include interstitial infiltrates, miliary disease, cavitation, lymph node enlargement, and pleural effusions. The latter findings has been decribed more frequently in the immunocompromised, particulary those with human immunodeficieny virus (HIV) infection. The report by Friedman et al. of 14 patients known to be HIV-1 antibody positive with chest radiographic findings showed interstitial infiltrates and focal or widespread alveolar consolidation to be the most common findings. The six patients showed groud glass opacities. Therefore, earlier reports suggested that there was difference in the radiographic abnormalities between immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals with pulmonary cryptococcosis. But recent reports show there is no difference in radiologic findings between of immunocompromised and of immunocompetent. Zinck and colleagues reviewed the CT and pathologic findings in 7 immunocompromised and 4 immunocompetent patients. In their study, nodules, either solitary or multiple, and often seen in association with the CT halo sign and other parenchymal masses and consolidation, are the most common CT manifestation of pulmonary cryptococcosis. A more recent report of pulmonary cryptococcosis in 46 patients by Lacomis et al. showed there was no difference in the radigraphic apearence of pulmonary disease between HIV-infected patients and other immunocompromised individuals. Bilateral pulmonary abnormalites and airspace consolidation were the most common radiologic manifestations of pulmonary cryptococosis in the three groups of patients ( solid organ transplant, AIDS, and non organ transplant and non AIDS). Nodules/masses were also quite common in all groups. In all groups, a combination of findings consisting of consolidation, nodules and effusions or lymph node enlargement (HIV and nonorgan transplant) was more frequent than a single abnormality.

","Contusion of the lung parenchyma is common in major trauma. The radiographic appearances are those of a diffuse ill-defined air-space filling with patchy, often confluent shadowing in the lungs.

The interlobar fissures do not dampen the spread of the shock wave and contusion may be seen on either side of the fissures. Schild et al. (2) imaged experimentally induced pulmonary contusions with CT and plain radiographs. CT detected 100% of contusions immediately after the trauma, whereas the plain films failed to detect 20% of contusions even after sequential examination. Lung contusion in itself is not an indication for CT examination (1). 
   Pneumatoceles may be encountered in association with pulmonary contusion. Shock waves cause shearing of a portion of the lung parenchyma with escape of air into the resultant laceration (3). This localized internal leak of air plus the retraction of lung caused by its inherent elasticity results in a rounded air space. The pneumatocele may contain a variable quantity of fluid, presumably blood. Pneumatoceles are usually first seen several hours after the injury. A pneumatocele usually does not have a well-defined wall in the early stages following injury. The visibility of a pneumatocele is ordinarily dependent on its size, the fluid it contains, and the surrounding pulmonary contusion (1). 
   If the entire space of pneumatocele fills with blood, the result is a hematoma. Both pneumatoceles and hematomas resolve, pneumatoceles faster than hematomas. Hematomas may take some months to resolve and for a considerable period may be the only visible sequela of previous trauma. As the surrounding pulmonary parenchymal contusion clears, a hematoma becomes more visible as a circumscribed density mimicking a neoplasm. Pneumothoraces and pleural effusions are a common accompaniment of parenchymal injury and may require chest tube drainage (1).","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-447-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-447-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-447-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-447-4.jpg']",25,['correct:9/25']

CT shows diffuse bilateral ill-defined small nodules and interlobular septal and intralobular interstitial thickenings, and multifocal areas of consolidation.

   The diagnosis of CMV pneumonia was made based on the detection of CMV antibody and cytomegalic change with intranuclear or intracytoplasmic inclusion body from BAL fluid.","Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia is a relatively common and very serious complication in organ transplant recipients. In particular, CMV pneumonia is often seen in allogenic bone marrow recipients (15-30%) and very fatal (mortality, 80-85% after 50-60 days).
    Two morphologic patterns have been described, the first and most common consisting of multiple, relatively well defined, hemorrhagic nodules, 0.1-1.5 cm in diameter scattered randomly throughout the parenchyma and separated by more or less normal lung. Histologically the nodules consist of foci of intra-alveolar hemorrhage, edema, and fibrin deposition accompanied by necrotic debris and acute and chronic inflammatory cells. Hyaline membranes can be seen, and a mononuclear cell interstitial infiltrate of variable severity is usually present. The second pattern affects most of parenchyma, with histologic features of either diffuse alveolar damage or interstitial pneumonititis. It has been speculated that the nodular form of disease results from hematogenous seeding of the lungs s from the an extrapulmonary source and that the diffuse type may represent either endogeneous pulmonary infection or an extension of the nodular form to involve more of the lung. 
    The most common radiographic findings are bilateral linear opacities (reticular pattern), ground-glass opacities, and parenchymal consolidation. Less common manifestations include small nodular opacities, a reticulonodular pattern, and lobar consolidation. In a report of 31 patients with CMV pneumonia after BMT, radiographic abnormalities consist of air-space consolidation in 12 (39%), linear opacities (reticular pattern) in 7 (23%), and GGO in 4 (13%); a combination of the three patterns were seen in 8 (26%). These abnormalities were first seen 26 to 270 days (median, 96 days) after transplantation, were bilateral in 22 patients and unilateral in 9, and most commonly involved the lower lung zones. In the current study, the most common CT findings were bilateral nodular or reticulonodular opacities and areas of air-space consolidation and GGO. In one investigation of eight patients, seven had a combination of linear opacities and parenchymal consolidation. All lesions were bilateral. The consolidation most commonly consisted of poorly marginated opacities that were predominantly peripheral in distribution. Pleural effusion was present in 4 cases and bilateral in three, which could be attributed to other cause, most commonly renal failure. Mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes were not enlarged. Although, the radiologic or CT findings were nonspecific or variable, in patients who have undergone bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia should be considered, particularly when the CT scans demonstrate diffuse nodular or consolidations and reticular opacities.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-290-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-290-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-290-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-290-4.jpg']",25,['correct:11/25']

","Askin tumors are malignant small cell tumors of neuroepithelial origin seen in childhood and adolescence, and very rarely in adults. It arises in the soft tissues of the chest wall, occasionally in bone, or, rarely, in the periphery of the lung. This neoplasm is now recognized as a type of primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Askin tumors probably develop from embryonal migrating cells of the neural crest. This neoplasm is an undifferentiated, small-round cell sarcoma and must be distinguished from other tumors that have small round cells, such as undifferentiated neuroblastoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, and lymphoma.

Two predisposing genes has been found in families affected by TSC (TSC1 & TSC2); TSC genes are considered to be tumor suppressor genes, and mutations in them may lead to abnormal differentiation and proliferation of cells.
    Pulmonary involvement in TSC is well known as pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), which has an incidence of 34 % in TSC patients. Histologically, there are two phases of proliferation in LAM. The early phase is characterized by proliferation of immature muscle cells covering alveolar walls, bronchioles, pleura and vessels, including lymphatic routes. In the late phase, there are cystic spaces and proliferation of muscle cells all over the lung.
    Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) can occur as a rare sporadic disease or as a complication of tuberous sclerosis (TSC). Sporadic LAM has no familial association. In more than 80% of patients, pneumothorax occurs during the course of the disease. Most patients with LAM die within 10 years of diagnosis. Deaths are generally due to progressive respiratory failure. Because the condition is limited to females and may be dependent on estrogens, the possibility of hormonal influence has been recognized for many years, and there have been suggestions that progesterone therapy would be effective.
    Patients with TSC often present with an insidious onset of dyspnea whilst non-TSC patients present more commonly with acute breathlessness secondary to pneumothorax. Patients with TSC are also less likely to suffer from chylothorax. The age of onset of symptoms and of diagnosis are similar. LAM is rare in children and even less common in males in both groups. Although symptomatic LAM is uncommon it causes a significant amount of morbidity and mortality both in the TSC and general population, but asymptomatic LAM is not uncommon in TSC. 
    The chest radiographic findings of LAM include the classic triad of reticular interstitial pattern, chylous pleural effusions, and recurrent pneumothoraces. The principal pulmonary finding in patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis is cysts. Some observers think that the cysts develop as a result of air trapping distal to small airways narrowed by smooth muscle proliferation. Others have shown lymphangioleiomyomatosis cells producing matrix metalloproteinases that destroy both collagen and elastin in the pulmonary interstitium. This suggests a role for these enzymes and the breakdown of pulmonary parenchyma in the pathogenesis of the cysts.
    Another type of pulmonary lesion in TSC is multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH). CT scan demonstrates multiple minute nodules present throughout both lung fields. Histologically, the nodules were well demarcated, and were composed of thickened, fibrotic, alveolar septa lined by pleomorphic, type II pneumocytes. This type of MNPH is extremely rare, and appears to be a hamartomatous proliferation occurring in patients with TS.

Chest CT scans also show global enlargement of cardiac chambers and small amount of pericardial effusion. Echocardiography demonstrated decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (25%)with severe LV dysfuction, dilated left ventricle and both atria.
    The pateint underwent mastectomy due to breast cancer. She had been treated adjuvant chemotherapy including adriamycin four cycles. Total accumulative dose of adriamycin was 360 mg per square meter of body surface area. ","The anthracycline derivatives, particularly doxorubicin (Adriamycin), are powerful antineoplastic agents that, when given in high doses (more than 550 mg/m2 for doxorubicin), may produce fatal heart failure. Adriamycin cardiotoxicity causes characteristic histologic changes on endomyocardial biopsy, with vacuolar degeneration and myofibrillar loss. Potential mechanisms of cardiotoxicity include free radical formation, release of histamines and catecholamines, and effects on mitochondrial function and nucleic acid synthesis.
   The incidence of heart failure is related not only to the dose of the drug but also to the presence or absence of several risk factors (cardiac irradiation, age >70 years, underlying heart disease, hypertension, treatment with cyclophosphamide); at any dose, patients with these risk factors have an eight- to tenfold greater frequency of developing heart failure than do patients lacking them.
   Between 5 and 10% of patients receiving at least 500 mg per square meter of body surface area develop overt heart failure, but more than half of patients receiving multiple courses have 10% decline in resting ejection fraction. The dysfunction may continue to progress, with 63% of pediatric patients who have received at least 500 mg per square meter having some cardiac dysfunction detected after 10 years. Some patients with congestive heart failure, even those with severe depression of left ventricular function, have demonstrated recovery of cardiac function with aggressive management with ACE inhibitors and diuretics. Cardiomegaly is the hallmark of dilated myocardiopathy. Although all cardiac chambers may be affected, the left ventricle usually is the most dilated with decreased ventricular ejection fraction.

Follow up chest radiograph after 7 days shows almost disappearance of abnormal opacities in both lungs (not shown). ","      The presence of numerous fat globules in the small pulmonary vessels results in dyspnea and hypoxemia. From the pulmonary circulation, the globules pass into the systemic circulation and embolize many organs, notably the brain and skin, where they result in a variety of neurologic manifestations and cutaneous petechiae. The combination of respiratory, neurologic and cutaneous disease constitutes the fat embolism syndrome (FES). The diagnosis of FES is based on the following major and minor clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. The major criteria included petechial rash, hypoxemia, CNS depression disproportionate to hypoxemia, and clinical or radiologic evidence of pulmonary edema. Minor criteria included tachycardia, pyrexia, retinal change (fat or petechia), fat present in the urine, sudden drop in hematocrit or platelets, increasing ESR, and fat globules in the sputum. At least one major and four minor criteria were required for the diagnosis of FES. 
      Whereas fat embolism is reported to occur in >90 % of patients with traumatic injury to the skeletal system, FES occurs in only 3-4% of these patients. Symptoms usually develop 1-2days after an injury in the long bones of the extremities or after intramedullary nailing or even after a minor trauma without bone fracture. Although the mechanism of FES is controversial, respiratory symptoms secondary to fat embolism syndrome result when fat emboli initiate an inflammatory cascade that cause increased capillary permeability following endothelial damage, diffuse alveolar damage and the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, the radiologic features of fat embolism syndrome are presumed to be manifestations of increased pulmonary capillary permeability and edema or ARDS ; mainly progressive bilateral airspace consolidation.
      There is generally a latent period of 12 to 24 hours between the inciting event and overt clinical manifestations, 85% of patents will develop signs and symptoms within 48 hours of injury. A time lag between injury and appearance of infiltrates often occurs in FES may be important in the differential diagnosis of respiratory insufficiency in a trauma patient, because radiographic abnormalities from pulmonary contusion or from thermal, toxic, or aspiration injuries are generally present from the onset. Chest radiographic findings are nonspecific and variable; but when fat embolism is extensive, a combination of multiple focal alveolar opacities, interstitial opacities, and nodular opacities develops with predominant distribution in the peripheral lung zones or predominate in the perihilar areas, simulating a pulmonary edema pattern.

Chest CT with lung window setting demonstrates abnormal interposition of lung between the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk which has rotated clockwise away from the mediastinum. CT at the level of heart demonstrates abrupt termination of the right pericardium at the site of indentation of the cardiac contour (arrow) where the heart bulges into the left chest.","Congenital absence of the left pericardium results from maldevelopment of the pleuropericardial membrane, which is likely due to an inadequate blood supply resulting from premature involution of the left duct of Cuvier (common cardinal vein). Both partial and complete absence are quite rare and were seen in less than 0.01% of 34,000 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery at one institution. Defects occurring on the right are exceedingly rare, presumably because the right duct of Curvier develops into the SVC, thus ensuring closure of the right pleuropericardial membrane. Although are usually asymptomatic, the most common complaint is vague chest pain, possibly as a result of adhesion or abnormal traction of great vessels. Deaths have been reported in partial absence of pericardium due to herniation of the left ventricle through the defect. Established radiographic findings of complete absence of left pericardium include an unusual cardiac silhouette with elongation of the left heart border, leftward shift and clockwise rotation of the heart, a radiolucent cleft between the ascending aorta and the main pulmonary artery, and the lucency separating the heart and left hemidiaphragm. The first two of the above findings related to the abnormal mobility of the heart, while the last two findings result from interposition of lung that is normally restricted by the left pericardium. The CT findings are homologous to those on the chest radiograph.

However, recent studies revealed that DIP differs from usual interstitial pneumonia in its histologic appearance, radiologic findings, and, most importantly, its natural course. Approximately 90% of patients with DIP are cigarette smokers. Most cases of DIP are currently considered to represent a reaction to cigarette smoke. 
   The most common finding on the chest radiograph is the presence of ground-glass opacity in the lower lung zones.

Irregular lines of attenuation, cystic changes, and traction bronchiectasis may also be seen but are usually not prominent. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis and micronodules are probably a reflection of associated respiratory bronchiolitis. An unusual CT finding seen in some patients with DIP is small cysts. These differ from honeycomb cysts in that they occur in areas not involved with fibrosis and may resolve on follow-up CT.

    The most characteristic appearance on chest radiographs is the finding of diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates and/or ill-defined hazy consolidation. HRCT findings are known as patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities, often central or perihilar. CT findings in patients with PCP reflect the stage of disease.

In treated patients with resolving of subacute infection, reticular opacities representing thickned interlobular septa and intralobular lines can be seen in association with ground-glass opacity. 
    Of particular interest is the frequency for cystic abnormalities and associated pneumothoraces in AIDS patients with PCP. Thin-walled cystic lesions are recognized in about 10-34% of cases radiographically, but they are more commonly identified with CT.

There have been many investigations of the histogenesis of the tumor, but it is still uncertain whether its origin is endothelial or epithelial.

SJS should be considered a spectrum disease with variable clinical manifestations and evolution that will be influenced mainly by the presence or absence of saccular bronchiectasis. Because the condition is usually acquired in childhood before the lungs have reached full development, the affected lung or lobe is usually small with reduced number of alveoli and subsequently hypodevelopment of the pulmonary arteries.
    Chest CT is the imaging technique of choice for assessing these patients. It provided accurate information on the status of the hyperlucent lung and particularly on the presence and type of bronchiectasis. The combination of a small hyperlucent lung and a small pulmonary arterial system suggested the diagnosis of SJS. Additionally, chest CT demonstrated a high incidence of contralateral involvement, particularly well seen on expiratory slices.

FD may extend throughout a long segment of rib, being 5cm to 19cm in length. Long lesions of FD may demonstrate variable degrees of expansion throughout. The matrix of this lesion may appear radiolucent or may demonstrate peripheral trabeculations and appear loculated, or it may demonstrate variable degrees of mineralization with a faint amorphous homogeneous increase in density, the so-called ground-glass appearance. Radiographic density of the FD is determined by the amount of woven bone. Trabeculated appearance is due to reinforced subperiosteal bone ridge in the wall of the FD.

We can also see the thickening of right paratracheal stripe. CT scans show 5cm sized mass conglomerated with right paratracheal lymph nodes along right lower lobar bronchus.,"Primary pulmonary tuberculosis is acquired by the inhalation of air borne organisms. The initial site of lung infection is variable, but often, the middle and lower lung zones are first involved. A focal pneumonitis typically results with subsequent caseous necrosis and lymphatic spread of organisms to hilar and mediastinal lymp nodes. In 90% to 95% of subjects, development of immunity results in healing of the lesions, with development of pulmonary and hilar granulomas. Hematogenous spread of infection also occurs in patients who have primary TB, but these organisms are inactivated as immunity develops.
  Radiographically, primary TB was associated with consolidation(50% of patients) that often involved the middle or lower lobes, cavitation (29% of patients), segmental or lobar atelectasis (18% of patients), hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (35% of patients), and military disease (6% of patients). These findings may occur alone or in combination, but in up to 15% of patients who have documented TB, chest radiographs may be normal. Hilar lymph node enlargement is common, particularly in young children.
  In most subjects, the primary infection is localized and clinically inapparent. However, in 5% to 10% of patients who have primary TB, the infection is poorly contained and dissemination occurs. Extensive cavitation of the tuberculous pneumonia can occur with endobronchial spread of the infection; rupture of necrotic lymph nodes into the bronchi can also results in endobronchial dissemination. Hematogenous spread can also occur as a result of progressive primary tuberculosis.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-282-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-282-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-282-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-282-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-282-5.jpg']",32,"['correct:4/32', 'semi:24/32']"

  It is an uncommon complication of pleural empyema. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the most frequent cause and is responsible for 73% cases of empyema necessitatis. Rarer causes of it include pyogenic lung abscesses (due to S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus species, gram-negative bacilli, and polymicrobial infections), blastomycosis, actinomycosis, malignancy or lymphoma.

The lung is the most frequently affected organ. The clinical symptoms are variable, but symptoms including respiratory distress, cerebral abnormalities, or petechial hemorrhages are present in some patients.
  There are two suggestions regarding the pathophysiology of pulmonary fat embolism. The mechanical theory proposes that fat droplets released from the injured long-bone or from adipose tissue enter the venous system and obstruct the pulmonary vascular bed. The biomedical theory proposed that the embolic fat is derived from the circulating blood lipids. These free fatty acids are directly toxic to pneumocytes and capillary endothelium in the lung, causing interstitial hemorrhage, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, edema, and chemical pneumonitis.
  The pathologic findings of pulmonary fat embolism consist of fat globules within the microvasculature, edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and in certain patients, hyaline membranes formation, or pneumonitis. Fat microglobules can be detected within the alveoli because of alveolar wall damage.
Radiographs may be normal in mild cases, but appear non-segmental distribution of ground-glass attenuation and airspace consolidation associated with interstitial thickening which mimic increased permeability edema. The lung apices are usually less severely involved. Radiographic findings return to normal after 2 days to 2 weeks.

Figs 3. Esophagography shows segmental luminal narrowing in the distal esophagus. The mucosal folds are well preserved. 

According to surgeons, the esophageal mucosa was intact and the mass peeled easily from the muscle layer. Enucleation of the mass was successfully performed. On gross examination, the surface of the mass was smooth and multi-lobulated (Figs 4-5). Final histologic diagnosis was esophageal leiomyoma. ","Although it is the most common benign esophageal tumor, esophageal leiomyoma is relatively rare, its overall incidence being 8-43 per 10,000 autopsy series (1, 2). The reported radiographic findings of esophageal leiomyoma describe it as a smoothly marginated, round or lobulated mass projecting to one or both sides of the mediastinum along the course of the esophagus (3, 4). Esophagography reveals it as a localized intramural mass contrasting with the surrounding air column (4, 5). According to the reported CT findings, esophageal leiomyomas are smoothly marginated, round or ovoid masses of muscle attenuation, lying intramurally or eccentrically within the esophageal wall. Surrounding mediastinal fat is not usually disrupted (4, 6, 7).

     Approximately 60 % of leiomyomas occur in the lower third of the esophagus, 33% in the middle third and 7% in the upper third (8). Their relative rarity in the upper esophagus reflects the smaller amount of smooth muscle in that region. About 50 percent of patients remain asymptomatic, while varying degrees of dysphagia and substernal pain are the most common presenting symptoms. Esophageal leiomyomas grow slowly and usually produce intermittent, insidiously progressive symptoms. Occasionally, they encircle the esophagus in a serpentine or U-shaped fashion and cause obstructive symptoms. Recourse to surgery depends on a tumor's size and location, as well as mucosal fixation, stomach involvement, and its adherence to contiguous structures (9). Enucleation without entering the esophageal lumen, or esophageal resection, is successful even with a large tumor (10).","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-378-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-378-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-378-3.jpg']",30,"['correct:23/30', 'semi:4/30']"

The ribs are asymmetrical and right ribs run vertically. Sternal depression is easily identified on lateral projection. Chest CT shows deformity of the thoracic cage.","This common deformity consists of depression of the sternum so that the ribs on each side protrudes farther anteriorly than the sternum itself. It is frequently associated with other congenital connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan's syndrome, Poland's syndrome, scoliosis, and Pierre Robin syndrome.  
  The roentgenographic manifestations are easily recognized. In posteroanterior projection, the heart usually shifts to the left, its left border is straightened, and the pulmonary arc is prominent because of slight cardiac rotation toward the right oblique.  Increased transverse diameter and a subtle central radiolucency of the heart may be present, attributable to the thinner anteroposterior diameter secondary to intrusion by the unusual clarity of the spine and of the right cardiophrenic vasculature.  The parasternal soft tissues of the anterior chest wall, which are seen in profile rather than en face, are apparent as increased density over the inferomedial portion of the right hemithorax and should not be mistaken for disease of the right middle lobe, even though the right heart border is obscured by a silhouetting effect. The ribs are often asymmetrical and take an abnormal course. The degree of sternal depression is easily seen on lateral roentgenogram. 
  The vast majority of patients with pectus excavatum are symptom-free, except possibly for the anxiety occasioned by the physical deformity. However, cardiac and respiratory symptoms occasionally have been attributed to the abnormality. A heart murmur is also fairly common, often simulating pulmonic stenosis and probably resulting from kinking of the pulmonary artery.",['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-536-1.jpg'],36,"['correct:23/36', 'semi:2/36']"

Some larger nodules have necrosis, cavitation, and air-fluid level. Small spot of calcification is noted on a nodule on the right upper lobe. ","Symptoms of pulmonary cryptococcal infection in immunocompetent hosts frequently are absent and the infection often goes unrecognized. When symptoms do occur they are usually indolent, progressing over a course of weeks to months. Symptoms include low-grade fever, cough with or without sputum, chest pain, weight loss, and, rarely, hemoptysis, dyspnea, or night sweats. In most cases, patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis do not become symptomatic until pulmonary lesions have become very large. As a consequence, many cases are found incidentally on chest radiograph or CT. There are 4 primary patterns of radiographic findings in immunocompetent hosts: pulmonary nodules, fungus collections, cryptococcal pneumonia, and disseminated disease. Approximately one third to one half of cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis in immunocompetent hosts are defined by pulmonary nodules, which are usually subpleural, solitary or clustered, and may be confused easily with reactivation tuberculosis. Cavitation and calcification of nodules is rare unlike the case with our patient. Pleural effusions are extremely rare in immunocompetent hosts. In immunocompetent individuals, the natural history of the disease typically results in spontaneous resolution within 1 to 2 months even in the absence of therapy. In immunocompetent patients is probably much higher than that implied by the literature given the tendency of the infection to remain asymptomatic and to resolve spontaneously even in the absence of treatment.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-279-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-279-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-279-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-279-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-279-5.jpg']",20,"['correct:7/20', 'semi:4/20']"

Chest CT scans (lung window images) reveal diffuse pulmonary consolidation and ground-glass attenuation in both lungs, predominantly in dependent lung. Also noted are poorly-defined ground-glass attenuation nodules. This was caused by Postobstructive pulmonary edema & hemorrhage (Negative pressure pulmonary edema & hemorrhage) due to upper airway obstruction caused by aspiration & packing for hemostasis at the site of tonsillectomy.
  Follow-up chest radiograph 2 days later shows marked improvement of pulmonary consolidation. ","Postobstructive pulmonary edema (negative pressure pulmonary edema, NPPE) is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema caused by upper airway obstruction. In children, it has been observed after intubation secondary to croup and epiglottitis. In both children and adults, it has been reported as a complication of postanesthetic laryngospasm, strangulation, hanging, foreign body airway obstruction, upper airway tumors, and obstructive sleep apnea. 
  Postobstructive pulmonary edema is the result of a marked decrease in intrathoracic pressure caused by forced inspiration against a closed upper airway resulting in a disruption of the normal intravascular Starling mechanism, ultimately leading to the transudation of intravascular proteins and fluid into the pulmonary interstitium. An obstruction that prevents both inspiration and expiration may create a high positive intrathoracic pressure that impairs the development of edema initially. Later, edema develops as the obstruction is relieved and the intrathoracic pressure suddenly drops. The onset of postobstructive pulmonary edema is usually rapid, and without prompt recognition and intervention, the outcome can be fatal.
Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage may develop following an acute upper airway obstruction. The mechanism underlying negative pressure pulmonary hemorrhage (NPPH) is stress failure of the alveolar-capillary membrane caused by the marked elevation of pulmonary capillary wall tension. Decreases in pericapillary interstitial pressure might contribute significantly to the development of stress failure in NPPH.
At chest radiography and CT, postobstructive pulmonary edema typically manifests as septal lines, peribronchial cuffing, and, in more severe cases, central alveolar edema. Cardiac size is usually normal, indicating a pressure edema that is not related to overhydration.
It is characterized by a rapid onset (within minutes) and resolution, with a significant clinical and radiographic improvement in 12 to 24 h. Most patients require temporary intubation and positive end-expiratory pressure. Diuresis and/or fluid restriction are often utilized. Hemodynamic measurements, including pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and central venous pressure taken following the development of edema, are normal.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-453-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-453-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-453-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-453-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-453-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-453-6.jpg']",22,"['correct:6/22', 'semi:9/22']"

On microscopic findings, pulmonary parenchymal hamartoma composed predominantly of irregular and broad cartilage masses. The cartilage is surrounded by a rim of fat or fibromyxoid connective tissue. The peripheries are lined by respiratory epithelium.","Hamartoma are relatively common pulmonary tumors, representing about 5 percent of solitary lung nodules. They occur most often in males, the gender predominance benign 2 or 3 to 1.
  A hamartoma may be defined as a developmental malformation composed of tissues that normally constitute in organ in which the tumor occurs, but in which the tissue elements, although mature, are disorganized. In the lung, the term traditionally refers to a well-defined tumor consisting predominantly of cartilage and adipose tissue. It can occur within the lung parenchyma or in an endobronchial location.
  Radiologically, pulmonary hamartomas typically are well-defined, solitary nodules without lobar predilection. The majority are smaller than 4cm in diameter, although some occasionally grow to a very large size. Although some studies have reported an incidence of calcification as high as 25 to 30 percent, others have identified it far less often. When calcification is present, however, the roentgenographic pattern most often resembles popcorn, a finding that is almost diagnostic. The presence of fat and calcium make the CT diagnosis exquisitely accurate. In a report of 47 lesions studied by CT, 30 (63.8%) contained fat only (n=18), calcium and fat (n=10) or calcium alone (n=2). Thin sections must be used to identify fat with certainty. On thicker sections, a small cavity may be confused with fat because of partial volume averaging.

Although it may be an isolated finding, it is frequently associated with a variety of cardiac, splenic, and other anomalies.

  Symmetrical hyparterial bronchi (""bilateral left lung"") have been described most frequently in the polysplenia syndrome, usually associated with significant cardiovascular anomalies including atrial and ventricular septal defects, anomalous pulmonary venous return, azygos or hemiazygos continuation of the inferior vena cava. Such patients may also demonstrate abdominal heterotaxia, malrotation of the bowel, horizontal liver, and absent gallbladder. Because of the strong association with serious congenital heart disease, thoracic isomerism is rare in adults.
  Indirect determination of atrial situs can be inferred from the disposition of the tracheobronchial tree imaged from either the plain chest radiograph or high kilovoltage filtered films. Bilaterally long and left-appearing bronchi are consistent with left atrial isomerism. Unequivocally, bronchial anatomy is more consistently predictive of atrial situs than the radiographic appearance of visceral situs, although even bronchial anatomy may not correlate with atrial anatomy.

Axial noncontrast CT scan obtained at level of thoracic inlet demonstrates polypoid and infiltrative tumor growth originating from left lateral tracheal wall. Parasagittal reformatted CT scan shows polypoid tracheal mass. ," Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a low-grade malignancy that arises from the epithelium of the glands lining the mucosa of the upper and lower respiratory tract. It is the most common carcinoma of minor salivary tissue but rarely affects the trachea. Of respiratory tract adenoid cystic carcinomas, <1% arise in the trachea. The age of patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the trachea ranges from the third to the ninth decade of life, with the average age being the mid 40s. There is no sexual or radial predilection and no association with cigarette smoking. Hoarseness may occur if the tumor is located in the proximal trachea and involves the glottis, or when there is invasion of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Microscopically, the neoplasm is composed of sheets of small, uniform cells, often arranged ih a cribriform of tubular pattern. This pattern prompted the former name for this tumor, cylindroma. A histologically solid patern, devoid of cystic spaces, is reported to be associated with a more locally aggressive neoplasm. Adenoid cystic carcinomas are nonencapsulated and are locally invasive, exhibiting a tendency to spread submucosally, along perineural spaces or along the perineural lymphatics. Grossly they appear polypoid or borad-based and infiltrating, and the tumor’s surface may be smooth or ulcerated. Typicaly, adenoid cystic carcinomas arise from the posterolateral wall of the lower two thirds of the tracea. Radiological findings of adenoid cytic carcinoma are similar to those of squamous cell carcinoma. An intraluminal filling defect with irregular, smooth, or lobulated contours is most common. The attachment to the tracheal wall may be broad or pedunculated. Circumferential invasion creates an appearance of tracheal stenosis. Invasion into the mediastinum may cause a paratracheal mass, whereas extension into a main bronchus may cause atelectasis or pneumonia or both.

","All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is an effective agent for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, that is, M3 type of acute myelogenous leukemia. This agent can differentiate the acute promyelocytic leukemic cells and reduce the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation with few cytotoxic effects, resulting in improvement of the outcome of acute promyelocytic leukemia. One complication of this agent is to cause ATRA syndrome characterized by dyspnea, fever, weight gain, and pleural and pericardial effusions (1.2). Some patients with ATRA syndrome have to receive mechanical ventilation because of severe hypoxemia (1,2). However, a prompt recovery from ATRA syndrome can be achieved by treatment with prednisolone (1-3).
  The ATRA syndrome occurs in up to 25% of the patients treated with ATRA, and no predictive factors of this syndrome could be found in the previous report. Post-mortem reports of the cases dying from this syndrome have shown the infiltration of maturing myeloid cells and edema in the lung (1). The maturing myeloid cells are considered to release various types of cytokines, which may explain several symptoms of ATRA syndrome such as fever, weight gain, and heart failure. These symptoms can be promptly improved by the steroid treatment which may suppress the effects of cytokines (4,5)","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-454-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-454-2.jpg']",21,"['correct:7/21', 'semi:7/21']"

A few rare case reports have described lung torsion complicating needle biopsy, pneumothorax and pneumonia. Most commonly affected are the left upper lobe and the right middle lobe.
  Torsion occurs when a mobile or extensively dissected remaining lobe relocates to occupy the space of a resected or atelectatic lobe and twists around its pedicle during the process. The middle lobe is particularly vulnerable after upper lobectomy because its small size expands to occupy a potentially large free space.

 Bronchoscopic findings are smooth occlusion of the brounchus in the absence of mucous plugs or mucosal irregularities or extrinsically compressed bronchus.
  The chest radiograph shows an enlargement and homogeneous consolidation of the affected lobe. The paradox of an atelectatic appearance without other signs of lung collapse should alert one to include lung torsion in the differential diagnosis.

Proximal to the dilated bronchi, there was partially calcified peribrochial lymph node eroding into the bronchus. ","Broncholithiasis is defined as a condition in which calcified or ossified material is present within the bronchial lumen. Radiographic findings of broncholithiasis include airway obstruction such as atelectasis, mucoid impaction, bronchiectasis, and expiratory air trapping. Some authors expanded the definition to include those cases in which peribronchial calcified lymph nodes distort the bronchial tree without extrusion of the lymph node into the bronchus. Broncholithiasis is strongly suggested at computed tomography (CT) when an endobronchial or peribronchial calcified nodule is associated with findings of bronchial obstruction. Volume data acquisition by means of helical CT with sections less than 3 mm in thickness and multiplanar reformation along the bronchial tree are helpful in confirming the endobronchial location of the calcified material. The most common cause of broncholithiasis is erosion by and extrusion of a calcified adjacent lymph node into the bronchial lumen, a finding usually associated with tuberculosis or histoplasmosis. Other causes of broncholithiasis include (a) aspiration of bone tissue or in situ calcification of aspirated foreign material and (b) erosion by and extrusion of calcified or ossified bronchial cartilage plates. Primary endobronchial infections with dystrophic calcification, calcified endobronchial tumors, tracheobronchial diseases with mural calcification, and hypertrophied bronchial artery with intramural protrusion may mimic broncholithiasis.

Small amount of bilateral pleural effusion is noted and both hilar lymphadenopathy are suspected.","Herpes varicellae (varicella-zoster virus) infection is seen in two clinical forms: chickenpox (varicella), representing primary disease in previously uninfected individuals, and zoster (singles), usually considered to represent reactivation of latent virus. The overall incidence of pneumonia in patient with chickenpox appears to be about 15%, but in adults admitted to the hospital it may be as high as 50%. About 90% of affected patients are aged 20 years or older, a relatively high incidence of pneumonia in sharp contrast with the low incidence of varicella itself in this age group-50% of cases occur in children younger than 6 years of age, and only 20% occur in adults. Pre-existing neoplastic disease, particularly leukemia and lymphoma, and corticosteroid and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy predispose to pneumonia. In addition, pregnancy, heavy smoking, old age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and severe cutaneous rash are also documented as risk factors.

  In most cases of chickenpox, there is a history of contact with an infected child 3 to 21 days before the development of disease. The onset often is marked by high fever, which may precede the rash by 2 to 3 days. Symptoms and signs of pneumonia develop a few days after the rash appears. When pneumonia develops, the rash tends to be unusually severe and often extends onto the mucosa of the mouth and pharynx.

Histologic features of pneumonitis in chickenpox and zoster are similar and consist of an interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, associated with intra-alveolar proteineous exudates, hyaline membrane formation, and type 2 cell hyperplasia (diffuse alveolar damage). Pathologic features of remote chickenpox infection consist of spherical nodules scattered randomly throughout the lung parenchyma. Histologically, they are composed of an outer, often lamellated fibrous capsule frequently enclosing areas of hyalinized collagen or necrotic tissue.

  The characteristic radiographic pattern of acute varicella pneumonia is multiple 5- to 10-mm ill-defined nodules or small consolidations that may be confluent and may come and go in different areas of the lungs. Hilar adenopathy and small pleural effusions may occur during the acute phase of the disease but are unusual. The small, round consolidations usually resolve within a week after the disappearance of the skin lesions, but they can persist for months. In milder cases, the infiltrates may resolve in 3-5 days. However, in widespread severe disease, the radiographic abnormalities may persist for several weeks. An unusual manifestation of chickenpox pneumonia consists of tiny widespread foci of calcification throughout both lungs in persons who had the disease many years before in adulthood. The calcifications vary in size and number but seldom exceed 2-3 mm in diameter; they predominate in the lower half of the lungs.

But the staging system of the sarcoidosis is only a means to describe the radiographic findings and patients do not necessarily progress sequentially from one stage to the next. 

HRCT findings of pulmonary sarcoidosis 
1) Nodules:  Nodules are the most common abnormality in sarcoidosis. Most nodules are 2 mm to 1cm in diameter and have irregular margins. Nodules occur predominantly in a perilymphatic distribution. Beaded appearance of bronchovascular bundles, a perihilar concentration of abnormalities, and associated lobular distortion all typify sarcoidosis, as compared with lymphangitis carcinomatosa. Large parenchymal nodules (>1cm in diameter) are seen less frequently and this large nodule often shows  so-called ""sarcoid-galaxy sign"".

2) Ground-Glass Attenuation
3) Alveolar Sarcoidosis: Large opacities with air bronchograms were seen in three of 44patients with sarcoidosis in one study. Peripheral distribution is common. The characteristic assocication with mediasitnal LAP and small nodules are seen. 
4) Reticular opacities: Irregular reticular opacities are likely to represent early mainfestations of fibrosis.
5) Distortion, Cystic air spaces, and traction bronchiectasis: Usually shown by posterior displacement of the main or upper lobe bronchus. 
6) Air Trapping: Narrowing of small airways occurs as a result of peribronchiolar granulomas.

     VATS biopsy was performed. The pathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar pattern. Multiple cyscles of combination chemotherapy were performed. However, dyspnea, cough, and sputum were aggravated. 

Figs 5-7. High-resolution CT scans obtained 17 months after initial CT show diffuse ground-glass opacities and consolidation accompanying multiple air cysts in both lungs. The bronchus in the involved lesion is stretched and squeezed. Compared with initial CT, the disease is markedly aggravated.  ","According to Akira et al. (1), high-resolution CT findings of diffuse bronchioloalveolar carcinoma in 38 patients were classified into three patterns: predominantly ground-glass (n=4), consolidative (n=22), and multinodular (n=12). Most patients with diffuse bronchioloalveolar carcinoma had a mixture of these findings. Cavitation of major consolidation was found in nine patients and cavitation of accessory nodules or thin-walled cystic lesions in six patients. In two patients, the onset of or increase in extent of the cystic lesions was seen within areas of ground-glass attenuation or consolidation. 

     Herein we present a case of adenocarcinoma mixed type with bronchioloalveolar features showing diffuse involvement and serially increasing cystic change. According to WHO classification of lung and pleural tumors proposed in 1999, the diagnosis of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma is limited to the non-invasive, localized tumors that show lepidic growth. In the cases that show stromal, vascular or pleural invasion, the pathological diagnosis should be adenocarcinoma, mixed type with bronchioloalveolar features. Therefore, most cases diagnosed as diffuse (not localized) bronchioloalveolar carcinoma before 1999 are adenocarcinoma, mixed type with bronchioloalveolar features. The CT features described by Akira et al. (1) can be applied to this case. 

     Cavitary lesions in bronchioloalveolar carcinoma are reported to be rare on the basis of radiographic findings (2,3). A CT study documented a 40% incidence of cavity or cyst in consolidative bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (4). CT is superior to chest radiography in detecting small cavities or cysts. Indeed, the incidence of cavitation indiffuse bronchioloalveolar carcinoma seems higher than expected. Moreover, cystic lesions may occur during the course of the disease. Cavitation or cysts can occur in association with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma in several ways. True cavitation is caused by tumor growth through ischemic necrosis, but it is unusual because the unique nondestructive growth pattern of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma usually preserve perfusion to the involved area of the lung (3). Ohba et al. (5) reported a 47-year-old woman in whom chest radiography showed bilateral, diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates with multiple cysts 3-10mm in diameter and numerous small nodules with central pinholes. At autopsy, bilateral cystic destruction of the pulmonary parenchyma was seen. The pathogenesis of cyst formation was thought to be due to two major mechanisms: central necrosis within the nodule and, more commonly, check-valve obstruction at the terminal bronchiole level. Thickened fibrous terminal bronchioles were found in some sections, which could account for the check-valve obstruction and formation of emphysematous cysts.

It is a variant of post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans that is most commonly the sequelae of a viral infection during infancy or early childhood. There is a necrotizing bronchiolitis (bronchiolitis obliterans) which damages the terminal and respiratory bronchioles and prevents the normal development of their alveolar buds.

Plain radiograph of right hand shows multiple calcifications in right thumb suggesting phleboliths that are typical of cavernous hemangiomas."," The enchondroma is a tumor that develops in the medullary cavity and is composed of lobules of hyaline cartilage. Typical sites of involvement are the humerus, femur, and tibia. Rare areas of skeletal localization are the skull, facial bones, patella. clavicle, sternum, scapula, ulna and vertebrae. The enchondromas in the ribs may lead to osseous expansion, designated as enchondroma protuberans, that simulates the appearance of an osteochondroma, or to massive enlargement of the bone. The radiographic appearance of enchondromas is usually characteristic. A well-defined, medullary lesion with some degree of calcification, a lobulated contour, and endosteal erosion allow precise diagnosis in most cases. Cortical expansion or thickening and pathologic fracture are other potential radiographic characteristics. 
  Chondroid lesions of the ribs are always seen at or near the anterior end of the rib. Therefore, lesions at the costochondral junction, especially if calcified, are suggestive of a chondroid origin. Enchondroma, which cause focal expansion of the rib, may be seen and may be diagnosed if typical chondroid calcification-“rings and arcs” pattern-can be demonstrated.
  Enchondromatosis(Ollier’s disease) is rare and nonhereditary, consisting of multiple, asymmetrically distributed intraosseous cartilaginous foci and subperiosteal deposition of cartilage, either exclusively or predominantly involving one side of the body; the affected bones are often shortened and deformed.
  Maffucci’s syndrome represents a rare, congenital, nonhereditary mesodermal dysplasia manifested by multiple enchondromas and soft tissue hemangiomas. It causes varying degrees of disability, but malignant transformation in the cartilage is the most severe complication, occurring with a frequency of approximately 20 percent. Radiographs are often pathognomonic in Maffucci syndrome. The radiolucent skeletal lesions are well demarcated and show expansile remodeling of the affected bone with predominant thinning of the cortex and endosteal scalloping. Matrix mineralization in the osseous lesions is frequent and shows the typical arc-and-ring appearance of chondroid lesions. Deformities of the extremities may be caused by interrupted skeletal growth during development. In the soft tissues, phleboliths?which are typical of cavernous hemangiomas?and soft-tissue calcifications may be seen.

  This patient had been suffered from an aneurysm in the left subclavian artery and thrombotic arterial obstruction in the forearm. Thrombolysis was performed by intraarterial instillation of Urokinase and intravascular stent was introduced to the subclavian artery. He was treated with heparinization for 2 days.","Spontaneous intramural hematoma of the esophagus is probably due to spontaneous bleeding within the submucosal layer of the esophagus, usually associated with a rapid increase in intraesophageal pressure, particularly in the presence of coagulophathy. The clinical presentation is often acute retrosternal or epigastric pain accompanied by dysphagia, odynophagia, or hematemesis. The condition may mimic Mallory-Weiss syndrome, Boerhaave syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, or dissection of the thoracic aorta.   Esophagogram may show narrowing of the esophageal lumen by a long, submucosal intramural mass. In cases with intramural dissection, mucosal tear or a “double-barreled esophagus” or “mucosal stripe” sign may be demonstrated.

The epithelial elements of pulmonary carcinosarcoma are composed of squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and undifferentiated large cell carcinoma. This tumor is rare, comprising approximately 0.2-0.3% of all lung malignancies and occurs mainly in the upper lobes. Carcinosarcoma occurs most frequently in males, particularly in smokers in their fifth or sixth decades of life. Broncho-pulmonary carcinosarcoma may appear as a central endobronchial lesion or a peripheral invasive process, the latter tending to be more aggressive. Distant metastasis tends to occur especially from the sarcomatous component of peripheral tumors. 

The prognosis is quite poor. The average postoperative survival is nine months and fewer than 10% survived two years. Although surgical resection is the treatment of choice, multi-agent chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin seem to be a reasonable consideration for use in patients with metastatic carcinosarcoma.

Chest radiograph shows huge well-defined homogeneous mass in left upper lobe, which is broadly based on left pleura and is sharply demarcated by left interlobar fissure on lateral view. CT scans show a well-defined soft tissue mass with moderate heterogeneous enhancement. Left upper lobe is compressed by the tumor. Low attenuating area within the mass suggests cystic degeneration or hemorrhage. US-guided gun biopsy was performed. Histologically, the lesion was localized fibrous tumor of the pleura without definite pleomorphism and mitosis. ","  Localized fibrous tumors are rare mesenchymal neoplasms that most commonly affect the pleura but have also been described in a number of other locations including the mediastinum and the lung. Extrathoracic localized fibrous tumors have been reported in the abdomen, the head and neck, and the central nervous system. 

   Many names have been used to designate this neoplasm in the literature; localized fibrous tumor of the pleura, benign fibrous mesothelioma, benign fibrous tumor of the pleura. Clinically localized fibrous tumor of the pleura(LFTP) occurs in both sexes and in all age groups but predominantly affects persons more than 50 years old. Most patients are asymptomatic; cough, chest pain, and dyspnea occur occasionally, especially in association with large tumors. Extrathoracic manifestations include hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in 4-35% and hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia, noted in less than 5% of patients, is usually associated with very large tumor and is thought to be due to glucose consumption by the mass. 

  Radiologically, a small to medium-sized tumor appears as a solitary, sharply delineated, often lobulated nodule or mass of variable size from 1 to 39 cm, and forms obtuse angle with the chest wall. Large tumors can appear as opacification of a portion of one hemithorax, and often forms acute angle with the chest wall as the mass is pedunculated or becomes larger than the pleural origin. LFTP exist in the costal compartement of pleura, within an interlobar fissure, along pleural surface of mediastinum, along the diaphragmatic pleura and rarely within the lung parenchyma. These tumors predominate in the middle and lower half of the chest. A pedunculated LFTP can change position and appearance with respiration or with a change in position. Calcification has been reported in 7% of tumors. pleural effusion was present in 8-17% of cases but is more likely to be associated with malignant tumors than the benign. 

  On CT scans, LFTPs are well-delineated, often lobulated soft-tissue attenuation mass in close relation to the pleural surface or fissure, and absence of chest wall invasion. Calcifications are noted in large tumors and related to the areas of necrosis. The tumors have rich vascularization and shows intense and homogeneous enhancement. Nonenhancing areas on CT scans correspond to necrosis, myxoid degeneration, or hemorrhage within the tumor. Identification of pedicle is a clue to the diagnosis. CT findings that suggest a malignant fibrous tumor include a diameter larger than 10cm, central necrosis, and ipsilateral pleural effusion. 

MRI is superior to CT for the morphology of a tumor, the relationships of the tumor to adjacent structures and, characterization of tissue. Tumors are intermediate to low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and of low signal intensity on proton density-weighted and T2-weighted images, which is related to hypocellularity and abundant collagen stroma. Areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images are related to areas of necrosis or myxoid degeneration. Intense enhancement has been reported after injection of gadolinium.

The lateral chest radiograph revealed a straight thoracic spine with absence of physiological kyphosis. On chest CT, the antero-posterior diameters of thorax and left atrium are short. The reason why the descending thoracic aorta line is obliterated on chest PA radiograph is that left inferior pulmonary vein, left atrium, and ventricle abut the aorta due to compression of the heart.","Straight back syndrome results from the shortening of the distance between the sternum and thoracic spine leading to a compression of the heart. The syndrome is caused by the lack of spine kyphosis. Straight back syndrome sometimes produces clinical symptoms suggesting acquired heart abnormalities.

It is commonly found as an incidental histologic abnormality in asymptomatic smokers and may be associated with CT findings of centrilobular nodularity and mild ground-glass attenuation. In some patients, the extent of alveolar accumulation and bronchiolar inflammation is severe enough to cause clinical, physiologic, and imaging features of interstitial lung disease. This clinicopathologic syndrome, called respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), occurs almost exclusively in heavy cigarette smokers. Since the clinical features of RB-ILD may be confused with other interstitial lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the imaging features overlap with other entities such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the diagnosis is often made on open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy.

  The chest radiographic findings of patients with RB-ILD include reticular or nodular opacities, most prominent in the lower lung fields. The CT findings of RB-ILD include ground-glass opacities, centrilobular nodules, and interstitial thickening.

The lung window setting demonstrates outer lobuation and irregular border of the nodule (Fig. C). Wedge resection of the nodule revealed metastatic breast cancer.","When a solitary nodule is detected in a known case of malignancy, the possibility of its being a metastasis is 25% [1]. Usually metastatic pulmonary nodules are well-circumscribed with smooth margin. Because tumor cells hematogeneously transferred to the lung proliferate into the perivascular interstitium, they appear interstitial lesions having clear, smooth margins. However metastatic tumors can actually grow out the vessels into the adjacent interstitium and alveolar air-space and then proliferate, destroying the lung parenchyma. Metastatic nodules with irregular margins can the expected to be relatively common. In one study regarding CT of pulmonary metastasis with pathologic correlation [2], well defined, smooth margins on HRCT corresponded histopathologically to an expanding type and to an alveolar space-filling type; those with poorly defined margins, to an alveolar cell type, and those with irregular margins, to an interstitial proliferating type. 

  A solitary metastatic nodule with irregular margin may be difficult to differentiate from a primary lung cancer. Actually development of a solitary pulmonary nodule in patients previously treated for breast cancer may represent something other than recurrent disease. Casey et al [3] found that 52% of breast cancer patients presenting with a solitary pulmonary nodule had primary lung cancer, 43% proved to have metastatic breast cancer, and 5% proved to have benign lesions.

Such cysts can be either congenital or acquired in origin. Congenital cysts are typically unilocular. In contrast, acquired thymic cysts result from an inflammatory process and they are usually multilocular, hence the commonly used term ""multilocular thymic cyst."" The cysts contain turbid fluid or gelatinous material, have walls that are thick and fibrous, and typically have evidence of significant inflammation and fibrosis on histopathologic examination. 
  They typically manifest on CT as unilocular or multilocular cystic masses. The cysts have well-defined walls, and the lesions frequently have prominent soft-tissue attenuation components.
  Multilocular thymic cysts should be distinguished from congenital cysts for several reasons: they may recur after excision, they may be associated with thymic neoplasms such as thymoma or thymic carcinoma, and they may adhere to adjacent structures and simulate an invasive neoplasm at thoracotomy.

The tumor is believed to originate from the minor salivary glands lining the tracheobronchial tree [6]. The term ""bronchial adenoma"" has been used to describe a group of slow-growing neoplasms, many of which arise from the bronchial glands, including adenoid cystic carcinomas, mucoepidermoid carcinomas, and mixed tumors, and carcinoid tumors [1]. Since these tumors are usually low-grade malignancies rather than benign neoplasms, the term ""bronchial adenoma"" is a misnomer and should be discarded.
  Histologically, mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the tracheobronchial tree consists of variable proportions of mucus-secreting cells, squamous cells, and so-called intermediate cells that show no particular differentiating characteristics [1]. The tumor is pathologically classified into low- and high-grade malignancy.
  Radiographic manifestations of 58 cases of tracheobronchial mucoepidermoid carcinoma reviewed by Yousem and Hochholzer consisted of a solitary nodule or mass in 41 (70%) and ""pneumonic consolidation"" in 16 (29%) (one case showed no abnormality on chest radiograph) [6, 7]. According to a review of twelve cases of mucoepidermoid carcinoma by Kim et al (8), it is more commonly seen in the segmental bronchus rather than in the trachea or the main bronchus. (distal trachea [n = 1], main [n = 2], lobar [n = 1], or segmental [n = 8] bronchus)  
  On chest radiographs, the tumor appears as a central mass with or without postobstructive pneumonia/ peripheral atelectasis or solitary pulmonary nodule. Prediction of endoluminal location of the tumor is plausible at CT, even when the tumor is located within the segmental bronchus. 

1. It appears as a sharply-marginated ovoid or lobulated intraluminal mass adapting to the branching features of the airways.

Only one case was reported the development of angiosarcoma as a complication of mediastinal teratoma previously. Several explanations have been offered for the appearance of second malignancies. Among treatment-related causes, radiation-induced carcinogenesis has been well recognized for nearly a century. Sarcomas, in particular, are typical of being causally related to ionizing radiation. Although angiosarcoma is not commonly encountered among such sarcomas, its occurrence after radiotherapy is well documented, especially in the treatment of breast and cervical carcinomas.

Calcifications along subcutaneoutaneous tissue and muscles are noted. There is no remarkable abnormality in the lung parenchyma.,"  Calcinosis cutis is a term used to describe a group of disorders in which calcium deposits form in the skin. Calcinosis cutis is classified into 4 major types according to etiology: dystrophic, metastatic, iatrogenic, and idiopathic.

Calcinosis cutis generally is a benign process. However, when present, morbidity relates to the size and location of the calcification. 
  Idiopathic calcinosis also known as Calcinosis Universalis, is characterized by calcium deposits in dermis, subcutis and muscles without any metabolic disorder or tissue injury. The ultrastuructural morphology of localized skin calcifications without associated diseases and with normal serum calcium and phosphate ion values is still unknown. Calcium and phosphate excretion may be low. In the histological sections prepeared with Von Kosso dye, calcium depositions appear first in the adipose tissue and collogen fibrils. These depositions move into the cutis and subcutis and make diffuse salt agregates. X-ray examination or sonography of the extremities and trunk for dense shadows due to calcium is important. Biopsy plays an impartant role as well. The lesions may be ulcerated and painful. A creamy material containing calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate may drain from ulcerous lesions. This condition is known as Lipocalcinogranulamotosis. Draining sinuses develop while the ulcers heal. Usually there is no infection, malignancy or tissue injury, and biochemical parameters are also within normal limits.

The most common and earliest HRCT findings of the bronchogenic spread of tuberculosis are centrilobular, relatively well-defined 2- to 4-mm nodules or branching lesions showing a tree-in-bud appearance. Pathologically, these centrilobular lesions correspond with caseation necrosis within the bronchioles. Because of the compact nature of caseation necrosis, the centrilobular lesions have sharp margins and relatively high attenuation in spite of their small size (1). Terminal tufts of the ""tree-in-bud"" structure may represent lesions within the bronchioles and alveolar ducts, while the stalk may represent a lesion that affects the last-order bronchus within the secondary lobule (2). 

     The lesions of tree-in-bud appearance are commonly accompanied by 5- to 8-mm, relatively fuzzy marginated nodules, thickening of adjacent bronchi and lobular consolidation. Extension of caseation necrosis and inflammation to peribronchiolar area and bronchial wall forms fuzzy marginated nodules and thickening of bronchi. Lobular consolidation pathologically consists of centrally located granulomas that contain caseation necrosis and marginal nonspecific inflammation. The areas of nonspecific inflammation appear relatively loose compared with caseation necrosis (1). 

     In this case, the tree-in-bud appearance is only seen on HRCT. There was no areas of fuzzy marginated nodules, thickening of adjacent bronchi or lobular consolidation.

The typical clinical symptom of leptospiremic phase include fever, headache, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and jaundice, which last 4-9 days. Leptospirosis can be complicated by ARDS, which needs the treatment of underlying disease and adequate supportive care with artificial mechanical ventilation. The main suspicious causes of the disease are heavy rain and water flooding during the summer, which leads to wide propagation of Leptospira. 

Leptospirosis can occur as two clinical manifestations: a self-limiting anicteric systemic illness, which occurs in 85-90 % of the disease, and a septicemic leptospirosis, 10-15 % of patients.

Many arise adjacent to the spine and in about 5% of cases, extend through the neural foramina into the spinal canal (the so-called “dumbell tumor”)(1). Tumors arising from the intercostal nerves can result in rib erosion, notching, and sclerosis because of their arising adjacent to bone and growing slowly. They can cause pressure erosions of adjacent ribs and vertebrae ? an important diagnostic feature.

Associated rib or vertebral deformity or enlargement of a neural foramen is visible in about 50% of cases. Nerve sheath tumors may also be seen in the middle or anterior mediastinum, occurring in relation to the vagus, phrenic, or recurrent laryngeal nerve, or along the courses of intercostal nerves(2).

On abdominal CT scan was done before 7 months, the saccular thrombotic aneurysm is present in the celiac trunk","Behcet's disease is a rare form of vasculitis of obscure etiology. Any large or small artery, vein, or organ may be involved in an unpredictable combination. According to the criteria set by the International Study Group for Behcet's Disease, the diagnosis is based on the presence of recurrent oral ulcers plus two of the following: recurrent genital ulcers, eye lesions (anterior or posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis), skin lesions (erythema nodosum, pseudofolliculitis, papulopustular lesions, acneiform nodules), or a positive pathergy test (pustule formation 24-48 hr after skin prick). Patients are usually 20-30 years old at the time of onset of the disease. The prevalence is considerably higher in Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, and the Far East than in the rest of the world. 

   Intrathoracic manifestation of Behcet's disease consist mainly of thromboembolism of the superior vena cava and/or other mediastinal veins; aneurysm of aorta and pulmonary arteries; pulmonary infarct and hemorrhage; pleural effusion; and, rarely, myocardial or pericardial involvement, cor pulmonale, and mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. 

   Chest radiography is the best diagnostic method for evaluating thoracic involvement in Behcet's disease, and shows mediastinal widening, air-space consolidation, and lung mass. Sudden hilar enlargement or intraparenchymal round opacities is a sign of pulmonary artery aneurysm. CT scan shows that that mediastinal widening was due to 

thrombosis or narrowing of the superior vena cava which caused mediastinal edema; that air-space consolidation was due to pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction; and that lung mass was due to aneurysm of the right or left pulmonary artery. They may recur, progress, or resolve, either spontaneously, within a few weeks to several months, or with corticosteroid therapy. Although no comparative studies are available, CT and MR angiography appear to be imaging techniques of choice for evaluating vascular involvement. CT also can demonstrate pulmonary parenchymal changes such as air-space nodules, cavities, and mosaic areas of lung attenuation. 

   Recently, helical CT findings of pulmonary artery aneurysms during treatment for Behcet’s disease were reported. Pulmonary artery aneurysms may become smaller or disappear with medical treatment. Mural thrombotic changes may be observed during the regression of pulmonary artery aneurysms. Perianeurysmal consolidation and air-space nodules, and mosaic attenuation areas may disappear during or after treatment. 

   Differential diagosis includes Hughes-Stovin syndrome that has indentical histologic and clinical features except for oral and genital ulcers. Both Reiter's syndrome and relapsing polychondritis may complicated by aortitis and aortic aneurysms with some overlapping clinical features. Arterial narrowings and occlusions, producing symptoms of vascular insufficiencies in Behcet's disease, may clinically mimic Takayasu's arteritis.

The remaining parenchyma is unremarkable","Castleman disease, also known as angiofollicular hyperplasia or giant lymph node hyperplasia, is a rare disorder of lymphoid tissue. unclear etiology and pathogenesis. This disease may occur anywhere along the lymphatic chain but it is most commonly found as a solitary mass in the mediastinum. Two distinct histologic patterns of Castleman disease have been described, including the hyaline-vascular type, accounting for 90% of cases, and the remainder of cases as the plasma cell type, which is often associated with constitutional symptoms. Three patterns have been reported on CT or MRI, including a solitary noninvasive mass (50%), a dominant infiltrative mass with associated lymphadenopathy (40%), and a matted lymphadenopathy without a dominant mass (10%) 
  In Castleman disease, CT with contrast material usually shows a dense uniform enhancement. Dynamic CT demonstrates early rapid enhancement and washout in the delayed phase, which are considered as typical imaging characteristics that help to differentiate this disease from other mediastinal tumors such as lymphoma etc. Furthermore, peripheral hypervascularity is a characteristic finding on power Doppler ultrasonography. A punctate or arborizing pattern of calcification may be seen. Some recent studies have reported a considerable number of cases showing heterogeneous attenuation. Meador and McLarney reported that tumors greater than 5 cm in diameter generally demonstrate heterogeneous enhancement. In several studies, a focal low attenuation area within the mass showing delayed enhancement on dynamic CT or MRI, was pathologically proven to be central stellate fibrosis interspersed within the mass. An MRI study has been reported to be useful for the evaluation of peripheral or tumoral hypervascularity and the relationship with adjacent vascular structures, because vascular structures appear signal void with high contrast to the mass.
  Treatment of Castleman disease is as follows. Surgical resection is recommended for patients with the unicentric variant of CD because surgical removal of a unicentric mass of hyaline-vascular or hyaline-vascular/plasma cell type is curative. But if it is not possible, partial resection, radiotherapy, or observation alone may be helpful instead of excessively aggressivie therapy. Patients with multicentric disease, either hyaline-vascular or plasma cell type, do not benefit from surgical management and should be candidates for multimodality therapy, the nature of which has yet to be defined..

When symptoms do occur they are usually indolent, progressing over a course of weeks to months. In most cases, patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis do not become symptomatic until pulmonary lesions have become very large. As a consequence, many cases are found incidentally on chest radiograph or CT. 

  There are 4 primary patterns of radiographic findings in immunocompetent hosts: pulmonary nodules, fungus collections, cryptococcal pneumonia, and disseminated disease. Approximately one third to one half of cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis in immunocompetent hosts define by pulmonary nodules, which are usually subpleural, solitary or clustered.

Over 30 reported cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome after intrapleural talc administration, 9 of these have been fatal. It is hypothesized that the mechanism for talc pleurodesis-induced hypoxemia may be the escape of very small talc particles from the pleural space through the parietal pleural pores. This escape results in the systemic talc dissemination followed by systemic and lung inflammation.

The extrapleural talc dissemination is a phenomenon dependent on both particle size and the talc dose used. In a study, talc pleurodesis with a mean particle size of less than 15 μm (""mixed"" talc) produces more lung and systemic inflammation than tetracycline or ""graded"" talc (most particles < 10 μm were removed).

With the finer CT collimation made possible by advancements in technology, the relative frequency of detection of the nodular ground-glass opacities will be even higher. The frequency of malignancy in nodular ground-glass opacity was much higher than in solid nodules, in the cases with internal solid part in particular (1). In addition, the distribution by malignancy type was strikingly different in the nodular ground-glass opacities as compared with the solid nodules. The malignancies in nodular ground-glass opacities were typically bronchioloalveolar carcinomas or adenocarcinomas with bronchioloalveolar features, whereas in solid nodules the malignancies were typically other subtypes of adenocarcinoma (1). The solid component in the nodular ground-glass opacities is caused by lack of aeration in the alveoli, perhaps because the alveoli are being compressed or are otherwise being inadequately oxygenated (2-5). 

It has been proved that GGO area on HRCT in small adenocarcinoma is well correlated with the pathological BAC area (6). Moreover, the prognostic value of the BAC component of small-sized lung adenocarcinoma of 20 mm or less in diameter was reported. According to the semiquantitative assessment of well differentiated BAC areas of the tumors, the 5-year disease-free survival rate was significantly better in patients with BAC greater than 50% than in those with BAC less than 50% (7).

Multiple skin nodules are seen on lung-window image.  ,"Neurofibromas are tumors derived from Schwann cells, fibroblasts, and supporting cells known as perineural cells. Typically, they are benign and manifest as multiple tumors. NF1 is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 4,000 births and no racial predilection. NF1 is characterized by multiple neurofibromas along the peripheral nerves, optic nerve gliomas, sphenoid wing dysplasia, pigmented iris nodules, and hyperpigmented macular skin lesions known as caf?au-lait spots. It is associated with a gene on chromosome 17. The formation of dermal neurofibromas is a hallmark of NF1 with a characteristic distribution on the trunk and sparing of the extremities. With time, neurofibromas may undergo malignant degeneration. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) most commonly occur in the deep soft tissues, usually close to a nerve trunk. The most common sites are the sciatic nerve, brachial plexus, and sacral plexus. The past literature referred to MPNST as malignant schwannoma, neurogenic sarcoma, and neurofibrosarcoma. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is the current term used by the World Health Organization for this highly aggressive tumor. MPNSTs may arise from plexiform neurofibromas, de novo or secondary to radiation therapy. At histologic analysis, the presence of mitotic figures distinguishes MPNST from otherwise typical neurofibromas. MPNST accounts for approximately 10% of soft-tissue sarcomas, and 40%?0% of MPNSTs arise from cases of NF1. Overall, there is a 4% chance of malignant transformation in NF1. Radiologically, MPNSTs and neurofibromas may appear indistinguishable; however, certain modalities are providing insight for differentiation. Gallium-67 citrate imaging has shown that MPNSTs have greater uptake compared with benign lesions. At magnetic resonance imaging, the different signal intensity characteristics of lesions with a higher degree of anaplasia are proving useful as well. Other factors such as a more rapid and infiltrative growth pattern are particularly helpful in distinguishing the two.

Another important clinical manifestation relates to the association between thymic carcinoid and the autosomal dominant syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), specifically type 1 MEN (Wermer syndrome), which is seen in 19%?5% of patients with thymic carcinoids. Additional associated conditions found in patients with thymic carcinoids include type 2 MEN syndrome. There are no reports of the carcinoid syndrome in patients with thymic carcinoids. 

   Diagnostic imaging of patients with thymic carcinoids usually demonstrates a large anterior mediastinal mass. The lesion may be localized or invasive. Some patients with occult or early thymic carcinoids have normal findings at chest radiography. These individuals may present with clinical evidence of ectopic ACTH production. CT and nuclear medicine imaging have been recognized as useful studies in the evaluation of these patients. Although few reports of cross-sectional imaging features of thymic carcinoid have been published, these lesions have been described as anterior mediastinal masses indistinguishable from thymomas at CT. Invasion of local structures and calcification within the tumor have both been reported. CT and MR imaging studies may be helpful in the evaluation of patients with occult, hormonally active lesions.

Local progression of disease, tumor recurrence, and metastatic disease are common in patients with thymic carcinoids. Thus, the therapy of choice for patients with these neoplasms is complete and aggressive surgical excision of the primary tumor, any recurrent disease, and distant metastases. Thymic carcinoid has an unpredictable behavior and a tendency to metastasize widely and recur locally even years after the initial surgical excision. Thus, adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy have both been employed with some success to treat affected individuals. Although radiation therapy is more commonly used to treat residual and recurrent tumors, the role of chemotherapy is less established.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-391-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-391-2.jpg']",27,"['correct:12/27', 'diff:7/27', 'semi:5/27']"

Contrast?enhanced CT scan shows polypoid hypodense mass in the left atrium. The mass is attached to the interatrial septum. Small amount of pleural and pericardial effusions are combined. 

   Photograph of the gross specimen shows lobular pedunculated mass with multiple leaf like projections. Photomicrograph (HE stain) demonstrates nest of myxoma cells, and myxoid matrix. Immunohistochemical stain shows expression of calretinin of myxoma cells. Calretinin is expressed in about 75 % of cardiac myxoma. ","   Primary tumors of the heart are rare. Secondary malignant cardiac tumors, often arising in the lung and the breast, are at least 20 to 40 times more common than primary neoplasm. The majority of primary tumors are histologically benign. 

   Cardiac myxoma is the most common primary cardiac neoplasm, and accounts for approximately one-half of all primary cardiac tumors. Myxoma typically manifests as a polypoid, intracavitary left atrial mass (75 %)  that arises from the interatrial septum, but it may originate in any cardiac chamber. Although most cases occur sporadically, familial lesions and lesions associated with a clinical complex have also been reported (carney complex). 

   Most affected patients present with at least one feature of a classically described triad that includes cardiac obstructive symptoms, constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise, weight loss, anemia, and elevated sedimentation rate), and embolic events.

   Presenting complaints relate to tumor location, which predicts obstructive sequelae and influences embolic sites (pulmonary or systemic). Cardiac arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter reportedly occur in approximately 20% of patients with cardiac myxoma. 

   The histologic features of cardiac myxomas are distinctive but heterogeneous. The tumor cells form rings, nests, and linear syncytia. The amount of myxomatous stroma is widely variable. Hemorrhage, thrombus, and hemosiderin are common and calcification is also common. 

   Radiographic manifestations of 86 cases of cardiac myxoma were reviewed by Mary et al. Most patients with cardiac myxomas have abnormal but usually nonspecific radiographic findings. Radiographs of 38 patients with left atrial myxoma showed evidence of mitral valve obstruction in 53%; radiographs of 16 patients with right atrial myxoma demonstrated calcification and cardiomegaly in 56% and 50%. Other nonspecific manifestations such as cardiomegaly and pleural effusion occurred in 37% and 15% cases. One-third of all patients in this series had normal chest radiographic findings. CT demonstrates intracavitary heterogeneous, hypoattenuated (81%)  lobular masses. MR imaging shows heterogeneous enhancing lesions and usually allows visualization of the point of attachment (78%). The differential diagnosis of an intracavitary cardiac mass includes thrombus and other much less frequent cardiac neoplasms, including sarcomas and papillary fibroelastomas. Left atrial thrombi are much more common than myxomas. They usually arise from the posterior and lateral atrial walls and from the atrial appendage. Left ventricular thrombi occur in regions of ventricular dyskinesia or aneurysm, and myxomas very rarely occur in this location.

Preenhanced CT scan shows 2 cm sized, homogeneous, low density nodule with well-defined margin in left lower lobe.

These are confirmative findings of pulmonary vein varix. 

","In the literature a pulmonary vein varix has been described as a rare lesion consisting of a focal pathological enlargement of a segmental pulmonary vein (1). This uncommon lesion usually presents as an asymptomatic, well-defined mediastinal or parenchymal mass on chest radiography (1). 

     Although most patients with pulmonary varices are asymptomatic, systemic embolization secondary to thrombosis of the varix, rupture of the varix into the pleural space or into a bronchus with hemoptysis could rarely occur (2). Pulmonary vein varices usually remain stable in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. Acute increase in varix size is indicative of elevation of left atrial pressure (2). The most common cardiac abnormality associated with pulmonary varix is acquired mitral valve disease, evident in one third of reported cases (3). Appropriate management involves mitral valve replacement rather than surgery of the varix itself. In case of hemoptysis in non-cardiac reason of the varix, lobe section can be necessary. 

     A pulmonary vein varix can be picked up on a routine chest radiography as a low-density, non-calcified opacity with well-defined edges. Because of resemblance to other lesions, such as malignant lung tumor, mediastinal or paramediastinal tumor (3), diagnostic work-up is important to avoid unnecessary investigations and surgical procedures.  In the literature, the diagnosis of a pulmonary varix has been described using selective pulmonary angiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Definitive diagnosis rests on the demonstration of the following features on pulmonary angiography: normal pulmonary arteries without shunting; normal filling of the veins feeding the varix; delayed but direct drainage of the varix into the left atrium; and limitation of the varicosity to the proximal portion of the vein. Because of less invasive nature of CT, dynamic bolus CT or single-slice helical CT could be good alternative diagnositic tools. The CT finding of pulmonary vein varix is dilated pulmonary vein opacifying simultaneously with the left atrium (4). The newly introduced multi-slice helical CT makes it possible to examine the entire lung with thin slices during optimal enhancement in a single breath hold, allowing better depiction of the pulmonary vascular tree (2). 

     In the literature, there has been no report of a patient with a pulmonary vein varix which is associated with an emphysematous bulla. Yet there was one report described a case of a pulmonary artery aneurysm causing massive hemoptysis in a patient with bullous emphysema (5). In our case, it is not clear that the emphysematous bulla is an innocent bystander or an associated finding with the pulmonary vein varix

     Tuberculous abscess of the chest wall can involve the sterum, costochondral junctions, rib shafts, costovertebral joints and the vertebrae. Multiplicity of the chest wall lesions seen in half the cases could be the result of a suppressed immunological response by host tissue. Destruction of bone adjacent to TB abscess though a common finding, is not always seen. It can take the form of disruption of the cortical margin or of an osterolyitc lesion, which could be expansile in nature. 

     Erosion of bone in TB results from pressure necrosis by granulation tissue and also by the direct action of invading organisms. Extensive destruction of bone can often raise a differential of neoplastic lesion. However, necrosis even if present in such lesion is unlikely to simulate the appearance of tuberculous caseous collections.

Multiple enlarged lymph nodes with central necrosis are also noted in mediastinum and left hilum. CT scan at the pulmonary trunk level reveals partial obstruction of left lower lobar bronchus by low density materials and focal filling defect in left superior pulmonary vein. The photomicrograph of bronchoscopic biopsy specimens reveals non-segmented hyphae with right angle branching pattern, typical findings of mucormycosis.

Patients with diabetes or a hematologic malignancy are particularly susceptible. Mucormycosis may present as in infection of the upper respiratory tract (particularly the sinuses) or the lungs.

     The most common radiographic abnormality is progressive, homogenous, lobar or multilobar consolidation. Pathologically, consolidation presents confluent pneumonia or pulmonary infarction and hemorrhage from large vessel thrombosis. Occasionally there may be pleural effusions or hilar lymphadenopathy. Bronchial occlusion and pulmonary pseudoaneurysms are infrequent and are more likely to be appreciated on CT. Because of the angioinvasive nature of mucormycosis, the masslike lesions may show the ground-glass halo sign on CT, representing surrounding hemorrhage.

Dyspnea was abruptly developed after colonoscopy,ARDS caused by aspiration of golytely (polyethylene glycol solution),"    A 70-year-old-man with no history of cardiopulmonary disease was suffering from abdominal pain. He was admitted and scheduled for colonoscopy. Initial chest X-ray obtained at admission showed no abnormal finding except emphysema. In the early morning before colonoscopy, approximately 2L of Golytely was administered by mouth. Severe vomiting developed during administration of Golytely. After colonoscopy, he complained about breathing difficulties and tachypnea. Oxygen saturation went down to 70% on room air. Follow up CXR after symptom onset revealed bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. HRCT scan of the lung showed diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs with underlying bullous changes. We suspected simple aspiration pneumonia of gastric contents with ARDS patterns. But, as his condition did not improve during the following week, we suspected permeability edema caused by Golytely aspiration. And then, we performed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and started intravenous methylprednisolone administration. After BAL, his condition rapidly improved. Repeated chest X-ray obtained 10 days after BAL showed near complete resolution of pulmonary infiltration. ","     Golytely, a compound solution of polyethylene glycol, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate is a purgative laxative widely used for bowel cleaning and surgery preparation. It also has been recommended for preparation before colonoscopy, for treatment of constipation, and for gastrointestinal decontamination. Polyethylene glycol causes a substantial flow of fecal water by osmosis, and because volumes required for bowel cleansing are larger than many patients can comfortably drink. Common adverse symptoms from polyethylene glycol include nausea, abdominal fullness, and bloating. Although less common, allergic reactions, angioedema, colonic perforation, esophageal perforation, Mallory-Weiss tear, ventricular arrhythmia, pancreatitis and several cases of life-threatening aspiration after polyethylene glycol lavage have been reported.      The intense osmotic action of the polyethylene glycol allowed a small aspiration to facilitate pulmonary edema, and its large molecular size prevented pulmonary absorption with a continuing osmotic action and the ongoing requirement for ventilation. So, pulmonary edema induced by aspiration of polyethylene glycol can be successfully treated by bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, concomitant with administration of systemic corticosteroid and positive pressure ventilation. Early bronchoscopy and BAL may prevent pulmonary edema and parenchymal lung damage and lead to shortening of both the need for ventilatory support and overall hospitalization time.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-482-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-482-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-482-3.jpg']",25,"['correct:9/25', 'diff:7/25', 'semi:2/25']"

So, most metastases are involved wtih the lungs, although recent studies have suggested a higher rate of extrapulmonary metastases in patients treated by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. At autopsy, the most frequent metastatic sites are the lungs (95%), bones (50%), and kidneys (12%) (1). 

     According to Kim et al (2), 45 out of the 134 patients had metastasis from osteosarcoma. Thirty-two of them had only lung metastasis and 13 had extrapulmonary metastasis. Among 13 patients with extrapulmonary metastasis, 6 had metastatic lesions in another bone other than the primary site and 4 patients had lymph node metastasis. Other metastatic sites included the pleura (n=2), liver (n=2), pancreas (n=1), kidney (n=1), small bowel (n=1), peritoneum (n=1), muscle (n=1), subcutaneous fat layer (n=1), and the pulmonary artery (n=1).

Metastatic nodules from a synovial sarcoma, giant cell tumor of the bone, and carcinomas of the colon, ovary, breast and thyroid may calcify. Calcification can also be seen in treated metastatic choriocarcinomas. 

     Several mechanisms are responsible for tumoral calcification: (a) bone formation in an osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma; (b) dystrophic calcification in a papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, giant cell tumor of the bone, synovial sarcoma, or treated metastatic tumor; and (c) mucoid calcification in a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract and breast.

In fact, approximately 20%?0% of patients with thymic carcinoids have invasive or metastatic disease at the time of presentation. Their aggressive behavior and high propensity for local invasion distinguish these lesions from thymomas. Thus, it has been proposed that these tumors be considered neuroendocrine carcinomas of the thymus and be classified as a subtype of thymic carcinoma.

     Diagnostic imaging of patients with thymic carcinoids usually demonstrates a large anterior mediastinal mass. The lesion may be localized or invasive. Some patients with occult or early thymic carcinoids have normal findings at chest radiography. These individuals may present with clinical evidence of ectopic ACTH production. Thoracic CT and nuclear medicine imaging have been recognized as useful studies in the evaluation of these patients.

Lymph node enlargement : Mediastinal lymph node enlargement is very common with sarcoidosis, occurring in 60-90% of patients at some stage in their disease. CT shows abnormalities, in order of decresing frequency, in the right paratracheal space (100%), AP window (95%), hilar (90%), subcarinal space (65%), prevascular space (50%), and posterior mediastinum (15%). Node enlargement is usually appear bilateral and symmetrical on radiographys. 



Lung diseases: 

---Nodules : Pulmonary granulomas are found in relationship to lymphatics in the peribronchovascular interstitial space, subpleural interstitial space and , to a lesser extent, the interlobular septa. Nodules appear as small as a few millimeters in diameter. An upper lobe predominance of nodules is common but not invariable. Nodules may calcify. Large ill-defined opacities with or without air bronchograms, having the appearance of consolidation, can be seen. Large nodules (1 to 4cm) are seen in 15% to 25% of patients. 

---Ground glass opacity usually reflects the presence of numerous very small granulomas.

---Reticular opacities and fibrosis. 

---Bronchial and bronchiolar abnormalities



Pleural disease : About 1% of patients with sarcoidosis develop pleural abnormalities, pleural effusion or thickening.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-484-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-484-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-484-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-484-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-484-5.jpg']",39,"['correct:27/39', 'diff:9/39']"

Interlobular septalt hickenings in RUL and RML suggesting lymphangitic metastasis.,"Mediastinal seminomas represent 3-4% of all mediastinal tumors and 40% of malignant germ cell tumors. These tumors almost exclusively affect men in the third to fourth decades. CT scans in patients with mediastinal seminomas show a large mass with sharply demarcated borders and homogeneous attenuation, indistinguishable from lymphomas. In some cases, seminomas contained small areas of low-density, making up less than 25%. Calcification is rare. Chest wall invasion is an unusual finding for seminomas. Pleuropericardial effusion also is an uncommon finding. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes, lung, bone, and liver occasionally occur. Mediastinal seminomas are highly sensitive to both radiation and systemic chemotherapy.

     Non-seminomatous germ cell tumor generally grow rapidly, causing compression and invasion of mediastinal structures in young adult men. 85-95% of NSGCT patients have at least one metastatic site at presentation. Non-seminomatous tumors contain extensive central areas of near-water density on CT scans, indicating cyst formation and/or necrosis. The tumor markings had a tendency for infiltration with spiculated borders and fat plane obliteration. Pleuropericardial effusion is common.

     Thymic Hodgkin disease typically manifests as multiple rounded lymph nodes that frequently affect contiguous prevascular and paratracheal nodal groups. Mediastinal HD may manifest as a discrete primary thymic mass or as a dominant bulky mass of lymph nodes. CT may show mass effect on or invasion of vital mediastinal and other adjacent structures including pleura, lung, or chest wall. Masses typically show homogeneous attenuation, but large tumos may show heterogeneous lesions. Mediastinal large cell lymphomas can present as a mass in the thymus with or without lymph node involvement. Large cell lymphoma of mediastinum is usually restricted to the intrathoracic region at the time of initial presentation. The tumors has grossly invasive features. On CT scans, the enlarged nodes in any of the malignant lymphomas may be discrete or matted together, and their edges may be well- or ill-defined. In general, they show only minor enhancement.

     Most thymic carcinoid tumors produce no symptoms. This  tumor is somewhat more aggressive than thymoma, being malignant in most cases, and SVC obstruction is much more common with thymic carcinoid than thymoma. Regional lymph nodes and distant metastases are reported in up to 73% and can occur late. Imaging findings are not specific and similar to other thymic tumors. This tumors usually appear as a well circumscribed mass or may obliterate contiguous fat planes. However, thymic carcinoid must be suspected when thymic mass is associated with clinical and laboratory findings of endocrine dysfunction.

     Thymic carcinomas manifest as large, ill defined, infiltrative anterior mediastinal masses and are frequently associated with pleural and pericardial effusions. Pleural implants are uncommon and they are locally invasive and frequently metastasizes to regional lymph nodes and distant sites. Thymic carcinoma may exhibit cystic changes.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-27-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-27-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-27-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-27-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-27-5.jpg']",49,"['correct:4/49', 'diff:14/49', 'semi:2/49']"

The left lower lobectomy was done. On gross specimen, an ill-defined irregular multi-septated cystic lesion (6.5x4.5x4cm) is present. It is apart from the bronchial resection margin. The internal surface of the cyst is graysh tan and fibrotic. 

     On the microphotograph (H&E stain x1000), bronchiole-like multiple cystic structures lined with columnar epithelium (black arrows) surrounded by smooth muscle tissue are shown.","Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung (CCAM) is characterized by an adenomatoid proliferation of bronchiole-like structures and cysts formation. The condition is most commonly found in newborns and children and it may be associated with other malformations; rarely, the presentation is delayed until adulthood, so it should be considered in the presence of recurrent lung infections.  

     Typical histologic feature of CCAM are adenomatoid proliferation of bronchiole-like structures and macro- or microcysts lined by columnar or cuboidal epithelium and absence of cartilage and bronchial glands. Inflammatory changes are not found in infants, but may be present in adult patients result from recurrent infection. 

     Based on the size of the cysts, CCAM may be classified into three different types: type I characterized by multiple cysts over than 1 cm in diameter; type II with smaller cysts less than 1 cm in diameter; type III that shows solid lesions composed of bronchiole-like structures. Type II is commonly found in childhood, but is occasionally seen in adult patients. Though the etiologic agent is unknown, the insult probably occurs between 4th and 7th week of fetal life. The histologic diagnosis of CCAM is difficult in adult patient, perhaps because of supervening infections that sometimes distort the underlying diagnostic pathologic appearances and make them difficult to recognize. 

     Hemopneumothorax, pyopneumothorax and recurrent pneumothorax have been described in association with CCAM. Some malignant tumor such as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, blastoma and sarcoma can be arising from the CCAM. 

     CT scans show the variable findings of CCAM; one of the most findings are areas with small cysts (90%), <2cm in diameter, and large (86%) cysts and areas of consolidation (43%) with heterogeneous attenuation and areas of low attenuation around cystic lesions (29%). Cysts that CT showed to be filled with air, fluid, or both correlated completely with the pathologic findings. Areas of consolidation corresponded histological to areas of glandular or bronchiolar structures with or without areas of endogenous lipoid or organizing pneumonia or mucus plugs. Areas of low attenuation corresponded to areas of microcysts blended with normal lung parenchyma.

     Surgical resection is treatment of choice in adult patients, because of the risk of recurrent pulmonary infections, malignant transformation and pleural complication mentioned above. Lobectomy is the treatment of choice, but sometimes a larger resection is required, when the lesion involves more than one lobe.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-29-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-29-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-29-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-29-4.jpg']",45,"['correct:5/45', 'diff:13/45']"

        Chest Radiographs show a bilateral reticular pattern predominantly involving the lower lung zones and subpleural lung regions. Cystic areas of honeycombing are visible in about half of cases. Decreased lung volume is typical. On HRCT, IPF is usually characterized by presence of honeycombing, irregular reticular opacities, and traction bronchitectasis.

On Waters view of paranasal sinus, total haziness of maxillary, esthmoid, and frontal sinuses suggesting pansinusitis.","Immotile cilia syndrome is a rare disorder in which there is an ultrastructural defect in the cilia in various cells. It is inherited in autosomal recessive manner with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 16,000. It affects the ciliated epithelium of the upper respiratory tract and therefore results in ineffective clearing of mucus.

     Parents of a child with primary ciliary dyskinesia generally have no history of chronic lung disease. There is a 25% chance that another child is affected by the condition.

     Cilia from the lung, nose, or elsewhere have a structure that is highly conservative and, moreover, resembles that of the sperm flagellum. The central part of the sperm tail, its axoneme, thus has the same well known 9 + 2 pattern as has a cilium, although it is about 50 탆 long whereas the human cilium is only about 6 탆 in length.

     The ultrastructure of the sperm tail from three infertile men with immotile but otherwise normal spermatozoa had been described in two papers in 1975; they were found to lack the so-called dynein arms, the structures responsible for generating the movements of cilia or sperm tails. The absence of dynein arms had not been described in any other organism, although flagellar (or ciliary) mutants of other types had been described from a unicellular green alga. In one of these two papers the spermatozoa of two brothers were examined and it was suggested that ""the two brothers have a genetic disorder in which the synthesis of the dynein proteins, or their assembly into dynein arms, is defective"". 

     Kartagener syndrome could therefore be regarded as a subgroup of the immotile cilia syndrome. The clinical consequences are the same and include chronic cough and expectoration of mucoid, mucopurulent sputum, bronchiectasis, chronic rhinitis and nasal polyposis, recurrent maxillary rhinitis, often agenesis of the frontal sinuses, not rarely atelectasis, and often otitis before puberty. The clinical manifestations include chronic rhinitis, sinusitis and bronchitis dating from early childhood. Treatment is symptomatic and directed against complications in the respiratory tract. Early physiotherapy is recommended. 

     An early diagnosis of the disease is important in order to start proper treatment of the child and to avoid other unnecessary medical examinations. If an electron microscopic examination has shown the cilia to have a normal structure, no diagnosis can be made. A functional test of the cilia is preferable. A simple method is the saccharin test in which small grains of saccharin are placed on the nasal mucosa and the time for them to be transported to the pharynx is measured. This technique is not completely reliable, however, and cannot be used for children under the age of about five years. 

     The most reliable test is one elaborated by Jorissen and Bertrand in which a biopsy specimen from the nasal epithelium is cultivated in a culture solution to which pronase has been added to dissociate the cells from the epithelium, as well as antibacterial drugs. After a few days the cilia are shed and after a further period of about six weeks a population of new cilia have emerged. The test records whether these fresh cilia beat with coordinated beatings which will result in a rotation of the isolated cells or cell aggregates. If there is no rotation after regrowth of the cilia the patient is diagnosed as having immotile cilia syndrome. In cases where cell aggregates from the original biopsy specimen show no rotation but the cells with regrown cilia rotate, the condition is classified as a secondary ciliary dyskinesia, perhaps caused by bacterial toxins.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-34-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-34-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-34-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-34-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-34-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-34-6.jpg']",59,"['correct:17/59', 'diff:12/59', 'semi:19/59']"

Bloody fluid was aspirated via the chest tube. He was previously healthy. Anemia was developped after admission and might be due to the venous bleeding from the pleural surface. After observation for one day, the patient was stabilized and hemopnrumothorax was successfully treated.","Spontaneous hemopneumothorax (SHP) is a complication of primary or secondary pneumothorax and can lead to potentially life-threatening conditions. SHP is a rare disorder, complicating 0.5?2% of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. It involves accumulation of air and blood within the pleural space in the absence of trauma or other obvious causes. The clinical picture can be dramatic due to the hypovolemic shock. 

     The mechanisms are bleeding either of a torn apical vascular adhesion between the parietal and visceral pleura or of torn congenital aberrant vessels between the parietal pleura and the bulla as the lung collapses or due to rupture of vascularized bullae. 

     A patient's age and history, clinical evaluation, radiological evaluation, air and blood aspiration, and hemoglobin determination in the aspirated blood can be very useful diagnostic tools in order to differentiate between SHP and a blood-stained effusion. 

     Therapeutic policy should be decided upon individually based on the patient's condition and clinical appearance of the disease. The goals of treatment include resuscitation, hemostasis, and re-expansion of the lung. Initial treatment consists of fluid resuscitation and drainage of the pleural space. Homologous blood transfusions may also be required, although most of our patients did not receive any since they were young and able to recover from the anemia postoperatively.

     Indications for thoracotomy were hypovolemic shock, continuous bleeding (100 ml/h), persistent air leak, impaired lung expansion, pachypleuritis, or recurrent pneumothorax. Intraoperatively, the bleeding site was identified, the adhesion cauterized or ligated, and the air leak sealed by excising the apicolytic disease. Subsequently, pleural abrasion was performed and effective drainage was secured. 

     Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery became the best approach for many thoracopulmonary problems, especially for spontaneous pneumothorax. It is considered an alternative method that reduces surgical trauma, causes less postoperative pain and results in shorter hospital stay. It can be used in elective surgery after initial resuscitation.

     Doctor should pay attention to the tube drainage because bleeding could be aggravated by chest tube insertion due to decreased intrathoracic pressure.

This patient was admitted for evaluation of abdominal pain and dyspepsia. And gastric adenomcarcinoma was approved. 

     Thoracoscopic lung biopsy was performed in LUL and LLL. A photomicrograph of specimen with H & E stain reveals metastatic adenocarcinoma. ","Lung metastases typically have two radiologic patterns: one or multiple nodules; and lymphangitis. However, it is known from histopathologic studies that metastases from adenocarcinoma may spread into the lung along the intact alveolar walls (lepidic growth), in a fashion similar to bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) [1]. In this pattern of growth, tumor cells line or fill alveoli in a manner analogous to that of exudative pneumonia, so called air-space pattern. 

     In a radiologic study [2], the air-space pattern of metastasis was high (10%). However, in one autopsy histopathologic study, Rosenblatt et al. [1] reported a percentage of pulmonary metastases showing a lepidic pattern of growth as high as 66% in small bowel adenocarcinoma, 27% in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and 15% in colonic carcinoma. The discrepancy between radiologic and histologic frequency of air-space metastases supports the findings of Fraser et al. [3] that occasionally the growth pattern of metasasis is lepidic, but it is rarely sufficiently extensive to simulate confluent bronchopneumonia grossly.

Bronchial luminal narrowing might be caused by recurrent bronchial inflammation.","The invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is an acute fungal infection of the lungs that is characterized by hyphal invasion and destruction of normal lung tissue. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis affects patients with prolonged neutropenia due to AIDS or with hematologic malignancies and those who have undergone organ transplantation. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis usually occurs in patients with advanced AIDS and a CD4 cell count of less than 50/mm3. Clinical manifestations of Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis include cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis. 

     Angioinvasive aspergillosis is characterized at histologic analysis by the invasion and occlusion of small to medium-sized pulmonary arteries by fungal hyphae. This leads to the formation of necrotic hemorrhagic nodules or pleura-based, wedge-shaped hemorrhagic infarcts. Radiographic evaluation, although nonspecific, may reveal poorly defined pulmonary nodules or air-space consolidation early in the disease process. Thick-walled cavitary lesions represent a late finding. At high-resolution CT, the term halo sign is applied to a masslike lung consolidation or nodule surrounded by ground-glass attenuation, corresponding to hemorrhagic necrosis. 

     Airway-invasive aspergillosis is characterized at histologic analysis by the presence of Aspergillus organisms deep to the airway basement membrane. Clinical manifestations include acute tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, and bronchopneumonia. Patients with acute tracheobronchitis usually have normal radiologic findings. Occasionally, tracheal or bronchial wall thickening may be seen. Bronchiolitis is characterized at high-resolution CT by the presence of centrilobular nodules and branching linear or nodular areas of increased attenuation having a ""tree-in-bud"" appearance. Tracheobronchitis with severe inflammation of the airways that is associated with ulcerations and plaque formation. This may lead to airway obstruction and secondary atelectasis.

It is a thin-walled nonmycelial budding yeast that is characterized by a thick polysaccharide capsule best seen on India ink preparations. Cryptococcal infection usually results from inhalation of organisms. The spectrum of pulmonary cryptococcosis depends on host defences. In the immunocompetent, cryptococcal infections are commonly localized in the lung and patients are asymtomatic; whereas, in the immunocompromised, cryptococcal infections often cause symptomatic pulmonary infections and often disseminate to the central nervous system, skin, and bones.
     Radiographically, the described pulmonary findings of cryptococcosis are diverse but most commonly include single or multiple nodular nodules and segmental or lobar consolidation. Additional features include interstitial infiltrates, miliary disease, cavitation, lymph node enlargement, and pleural effusions. The latter findings has been decribed more frequently in the immunocompromised, particularly those with human immunodeficieny virus (HIV) infection. The report by Friedman et al. of 14 patients known to be HIV-1 antibody positive with chest radiographic findings showed interstitial infiltrates and focal or widespread alveolar consolidation to be the most common findings. The six patients showed ground glass opacities. Therefore, earlier reports suggested that there was difference in the radiographic abnormalities between immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals with pulmonary cryptococcosis. But recent reports show there is no difference in radiologic findings between of immunocompromised and of immunocompetent. Zinck and colleagues reviewed the CT and pathologic findings in 7 immunocompromised and 4 immunocompetent patients. In their study, nodules, either solitary or multiple, and often seen in association with the CT halo sign and other parenchymal masses and consolidation, are the most common CT manifestation of pulmonary cryptococcosis. A more recent report of pulmonary cryptococcosis in 46 patients by Lacomis et al. showed there was no difference in the radigraphic appearance of pulmonary disease between HIV-infected patients and other immunocompromised individuals. Bilateral pulmonary abnormalities and airspace consolidation were the most common radiologic manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis in the three groups of patients (solid organ transplant, AIDS, and non organ transplant and non AIDS). Nodules/masses were also quite common in all groups. In all groups, a combination of findings consisting of consolidation, nodules and effusions or lymph node enlargement (HIV and non-organ transplant) was more frequent than a single abnormality.

A clinical diagnosis of a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema was made, thus we excluded other causes such as sepsis, volume overload, cardiogenic pulmonary edema and drug-induced lung injury. On the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, the diagnosis of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) was suggested.

     The patient was given supportive management, with a high concentration of oxygen in combination with bronchodilators. Clinical improvement occurred 12 hours later and the chest film returned to normal within 6 days (see below).","     Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is an underreported complication of transfusion therapy, and it is the third most common cause of transfusion-associated death. TRALI is defined as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema temporally related to transfusion therapy. 

     The pathogenesis of TRALI may be explained by a ""two-hit"" hypothesis, with the first ""hit"" being a predisposing inflammatory condition commonly present in the operating room or ICU. The second hit may involve the passive transfer of neutrophil or HLA antibodies from the donor or the transfusion of biologically active lipids from older, cellular blood products.  

     The diagnosis of TRALI relies on excluding other diagnoses such as sepsis, volume overload, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Supportive diagnostic evidence includes identifying neutrophil or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in the donor or recipient plasma. All plasma-containing blood products have been implicated in TRALI, with the majority of cases linked to whole blood, packed RBCs, platelets, and fresh-frozen plasma. 

     Radiographic finding shows diffuse, fluffy infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema, which may be patchy in the first few hours, with progression of the alveolar and interstitial infiltrates such that the entire lung is obscured. Resolution often occurs rapidly, even when initial hypoxemia is severe. Most patients can be extubated within 48 hours, and chest radiographs typically return to normal in 4 days, although hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates persist up to 7 days in a minority of patients.

     The first step in the treatment of TRALI is to make the correct diagnosis. Treating TRALI like cardiogenic pulmonary edema or volume overload may lead to adverse outcomes. Treatment is supportive, with a prognosis substantially better than most causes of clinical acute lung injury.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-487-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-487-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-487-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-487-4.jpg']",43,"['correct:18/43', 'diff:2/43', 'semi:7/43']"

     Wedge resection of cystic mass was performed. Histologic examination showed cyst walls lined by respiratory epithelium, a finding consistent with bronchogenic cyst rather than bulla.","Bronchogenic cyst develops as a result of abnormal budding of the ventral foregut during the gestational period. The wall is lined by ciliated columnar or cuboidal epithelium and is surrounded by tissues that may be found in the normal bronchus, such as cartilage, smooth muscle, elastic tissue and mucous glands. 

     Although a majority of bronchogenic cysts is known to arise in the mediastinum, less than a third of bronchogenic cysts have been reported to arise within the lung parenchyma. Intraparenchymal (pulmonary) bronchogenic cyst is usually solitary and appears no different radiologically from bronchogenic cysts arising in the mediastinum ?a sharply defined, uncalcified round or oval density showing homogeneous internal water density. The attenuation of the internal content may be higher owing to higher concentrations of proteinaceous mucus, hemorrhage, calcium, or calcium oxalate. Intraparenchymal bronchogenic cyst may be air-filled or even demonstrate an air-fluid level depending on the presence of communication with an adjacent bronchus. This may explain the relatively higher incidence of infection than in its mediastinal counterpart.

One day after operation for chronic osteomyelitis in the shaft of left femur, chest radiograph shows multifocal patchy ground-glass opacity and consolidation in both lungs with predominantly peripheral rather than central. 

     Chest CT shows multifocal ground-glass opacity and consolidation confined to some lobules with a sharp margin between areas of involved and noninvolved lung, resulting in a geographic appearance, with predominantly non-dependent distribution. Smooth interlobular septal line thickenings are noted. ","    Fat embolism is an infrequent complication of long bone fracture, occurring in 1% - 3% of patients with simple tibial or femoral fractures but in up to 20% of individuals with more severe trauma. Less common causes include hemoglobinopathy, major burns, pancreatitis, overwhelming infection, tumors, blood transfusion, and liposuction. The mechanisms are not completely understood but presumably are twofold. The first mechanism is the production of free fatty acids, which initiates a toxic reaction in the endothelium. The process is further complicated by the accumulation of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells, which causes damage to the vasculature. The second mechanism is the mechanical obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature by fat globules and aggregates of red blood cells and platelets.

     A combination of pulmonary, cerebral, and cutaneous symptoms typically occur within 12-24 hours of the traumatic event. The time lapse between the traumatic event and radiographic abnormalities is usually 1-2 days, which allows differentiation from traumatic contusion.

     Chest radiographs may be entirely normal in mild cases, and even in severe cases, chest radiographs may be normal for the first 1 to 3 days. Radiographic changes appear 1-3 days after the embolic event and consist of subtle, increased attenuation or a pattern of alveolar pulmonary edema. The distribution of these opacities varies from a predominantly perihilar pattern to that of a more peripheral process. The lung apices are usually less severely involved. The opacities are caused by focal atelectasis, hemorrhage, alveolar edema, and infarction. On sequential examinations, radiographic findings return to normal after 2 days to 2 weeks, with an average resolution time of 1 week.

     The CT findings of pulmonary fat embolism include focal areas of consolidation or ground-glass opacity and nodules, predominantly in the nondependent and peripheral portions, and in both upper lobes of the lungs.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-488-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-488-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-488-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-488-4.jpg']",56,"['correct:39/56', 'diff:3/56', 'semi:3/56']"

It also demonstates multiple well-defined micronodules in right middle lobe and both lower lobes, which are revealed to be extensive dense calcifications on mediastinal window setting.","Most of the cases of metastatic pulmonary calcification occur in patients with hypercalcemia, particularly those with hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal failure. Less common causes include hypercalcemia related to primary hyperparathyroidism, skeletal metastases, and multiple myeloma. Rarely, it may occur in patients with normal renal function, normal calcium and phosphate levels, and no underlying pulmonary disease.

     Most of the patients with metastatic pulmonary calcification are asymptomatic and pulmonary function tests are usually normal. However, restrictive lung function, decreased diffusing capacity, hypoxemia, and, occasionally, respiratory failure may occur.

     Metastatic calcification tends to involve mainly the upper lung zones. This distribution is presumed to be related to the higher ventilation-perfusion ratio in the upper lung zones as compared with the lower zones, which results in a lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide and thus a higher pH in the upper lung zones.

     Metastatic pulmonary calcification is a process characterized histologically by the deposition of calcium salts predominantly in the interstitial tissue of alveolar septa with a particular affinity for elastic tissue. Other sites include walls of small blood vessels, bronchi, and bronchioles. Other sites include walls of small blood vessels, bronchi, bronchioles, and myocardium.

     Chest radiograph is useful for detection of pleural calcification, hilar and mediastinal lymph node calcification, calcified lung nodules, diffuse parenchymal calcification. Diffuse calcification is often mistaken for another process such as pulmonary edema or intrapulmonary hemorrhage. Similarly, localized pulmonary calcification is often confused with infarction, pneumonia, or malignancy.

     The HRCT findings include (1) multiple calcified and/or apparently noncalcified nodules distributed diffusely or more localized to the certain regions, (2) diffuse or patchy areas of ground glass opacification or ill-defined patchy infiltrate, and (3) a relatively dense area of consolidation. Moreover, calcification of the tracheobronchial walls and chest wall blood vessels may be seen. A ring pattern of nodular calcification was also described.

2. The extent of a reticular pattern on long-term follow-up CT scans was directly correlated with the extent of ground-glass opacification on initial CT. 

3. There were correlations between the extent of a reticular pattern on the follow-up CT scans and the total duration of mechanical ventilation, the duration of pressure-controlled inverse-ratio ventilation, and the duration of synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. 

4. The extents of a reticular pattern and of ground-glass opacification combined showed a significant negative correlation with the forced vital capacity and a positive correlation with the residual volume and the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity.

The authors (2) suggested that the anterior reticular pattern resulted from alveolar overdistention in ""unprotected"" nonconsolidated lung. During the acute phase of ARDS, hyperattenuating areas of unaerated or collapsed parenchyma are typically seen in dependent parts of the lung (3, 4).

Chest CT shows multiple lymph node enlargement in paratracheal, subcarinal, bilateral hilar, and bilateral interlobar area. ","Sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder of unknown cause with a wide variety of clinical and radiologic manifestations. Thoracic involvement is reported in up to 90% of patients with sarcoidosis and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is the most common radiologic finding frequently with associated pulmonary infiltrates and typically has a characteristic perivascular distribution at high-resolution chest computed tomography. There are five radiologic stages of intrathoracic changes: Stage 0, normal chest radiograph; stage 1, lymphadenopathy only; stage 2, lymphadenopathy with parenchymal infiltration; stage 3, parenchymal disease only; and stage 4, pulmonary fibrosis. One-half of patients present with stage 1 disease.

     Asymptomatic involvement of the CNS is present in up to 25% of patients at autopsy, whereas clinically recognizable involvement is seen in less than 10% of patients. Manifestations of neurosarcoidosis are variable and depend on the site and extent of involvement. The prognosis is also variable, ranging from a self-limiting process to a progressive course. Although the radiologic features of CNS sarcoidosis may simulate those of infectious or metastatic disease, mild clinical manifestations and laboratory data from cerebrospinal fluid analysis, such as increased ACE titer and CD4:CD8 ratio, may be useful in differentiating CNS sarcoidosis from other disease entities. 

     Neurosarcoidosis has a strong predilection for the base of the brain. Neuroendocrine disorders such as diabetes insipidus that arise owing to involvement of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus are relatively common, although the anterior pituitary gland is rarely involved. By facial and optic nerve involvement, bilateral facial nerve palsy and decreased visual acuity can occur. These palsies often demonstrate rapid onset with spontaneous resolution. Periventricular and deep white matter lesions are commonly seen and are typically hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Leptomeningeal involvement, which is most commonly observed at the base of the brain, is also a frequent manifestation of CNS sarcoidosis and causes aseptic meningitis. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging can accurately depict diffuse enhancement in these lesions. These radiologic appearances may occasionally mimic those of granulomatous meningitis, including tuberculosis or carcinomatous meningitis. 



     Decreased secretion or action of argininevasopressin (AVP) usually manifests as diabetes insipidus (DI), a syndrome characterized by the production of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine. The 24-h urine volume is >50 mL/kg body weight and the osmolarity is <300 mosmol/L. Deficient secretion of AVP can be primary or secondary. The primary form usually results from agenesis or irreversible destruction of the neurohypophysis and is variously referred to as neurohypophyseal DI, pituitary DI, or central DI. Secondary deficiencies of AVP result from inhibition of secretion by excessive intake of fluids. They are referred to as primary polydipsia. Neurosarcoidosis is one of causes of central DI.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-397-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-397-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-397-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-397-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-397-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-397-6.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-397-7.jpg']",45,"['correct:36/45', 'diff:5/45']"

Histologic types of malignant germ cell tumors that occur in the mediastinum include seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, endodermal sinus tumor, choriocarcinoma, and mixed germ cell tumors. Seminoma is the most common pure histologic type in men and accounts for 40% of such tumors. Malignant mediastinal germ cell tumors are usually encountered in young adults and are much more common in men than women.

This mass manifests itself as heterogenous attenuation.","     Pyothorax-associated lymphoma (PAL) is a distinctive type of malignant lymphoma of mostly B-cell nature, strongly associated with EBV infection. PAL develops in the pleural cavity after a long-standing history of pyothorax. According to Nakatsuka et al’s study, 80% of the patients have a history of pyothorax resulting from artificial pneumothorax for treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, and 17% of the patients have a tuberculous pleuritis.

     Chest and/or back pain are the most common presenting symptoms, which are not features of chronic pyothorax. CT is recommended for follow-up of patients with chronic pyothorax and PAL, because mass can be detected in 85% of patients by CT. However, soft-tissue masses in chronic pyothorax may correspond to several disease processes. Acute reactivation of tuberculosis is one possibility, and other pathogen such as aspergillosis or microorganisms can cause superimposing infection. Neoplasms other than lymphoma, such as mesothelioma, squamous cell carcinoma, and soft-tissue sarcoma, have been associated with chronic tuberculous empyema. It is difficult to differentiate PAL from these other diseases by means of imaging alone, biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Percutaneous core biopsy is the simplest way of obtaining samples of tumors.

     The symptom/sign and radiographic findings in PAL patients often suggest a diagnosis of lung cancer, especially small cell lung cancer. Moreover, the serum levels of NSE are occasionally elevated in PAL patients, which suggest the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. The NSE levels in PAL decrease after chemotherapy in most cases; thus, the serum NSE levels can be a useful marker for monitoring the disease activity of PAL.

For decades KS was considered a rare disease that mostly affected elderly men of Mediterranean or Jewish heritage, organ transplant patients, or young adult African men. This type is called classic Kaposi sarcoma. In the last 20 years, however, most KS cases have developed in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is called AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma (epidemic KS). Epidemic KS spreads through the whole body and causes widespread lesions that develop not only on the skin and in the mouth, but also the lymph nodes and other organs, usually the gastrointestinal tract, lung, liver, and spleen. In contrast, classic KS usually affects only one or a few areas of skin, most often the lower legs. KS does become life threatening when it is in the lungs, liver, or gastrointestinal tract. KS in the gastrointestinal tract can produce bleeding, while tumors in the lungs may cause difficulty breathing.

     Pulmonary involvement occurs initially in the interstitial tissue of the bronchovascular bundles, interlobular septa, and pleura. Infiltration into the adjacent lung parenchyma may result in nodules or poorly defined areas of consolidation. The most common radiographic abnormality consists of nodular opacities usually measuring 1 to 2 cm in diameter and having irregular or poorly defined margins. The abnormalities tend to be bilateral and symmetric and in 90% of patients involve mainly the perihilar regions, other common findings are bronchial wall thickening and thickening of interlobular septa.

     HRCT demonstrates bronchial wall thickening, peribronchial consolidation, and multiple bilateral nodules with irregular margins in a predominantly peribronchovascular distribution. The nodules usually have markedly irregular (flame-shaped) or poorly defined margins, reflecting the extension of tumor within the peribronchovascular interstitial tissue.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-154-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-154-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-154-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-154-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-154-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-154-6.jpg']",20,"['correct:7/20', 'diff:2/20']"

Air culture from her house revealed growth of fungus (not definite, but suspicious for Trichosporon species). Her symptoms have gradually improved after institution of corticosteroid therapy and after cessation of rainy spell. ","Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an immunologically induced inflammation of the lung parenchyma resulting from the repeated inhalation of a variety of etiologic agents including organic dusts and chemicals. Diagnosis is frequently delayed because symptoms are nonspecific and a relevant exposure history may be absent. Elevated antibody titers to inhaled antigens can suggest the diagnosis. Lung biopsy is often necessary for confident diagnosis, and histopathologic features include cellular bronchiolitis, diffuse lymphocytic interstitial infiltration, and noncaseating granulomas. 

     Summer-type HP whose major causative agent is Trichosporon species is the most prevalent type in Japan, characterized by symptoms that appear during the summer months, repeated episodes during subsequent seasons for many years, provocation of symptoms when at home, familial occurrence, and other manifestations similar to those of other types of HP. The hot, humid summer season and living environment with traditional wooden house are very similar to those of Korea, and there are many articles reporting cases of summer-type HP occurring in Korea. There are no difference in radiologic findings between summer-type and other types of HP. 

     Although considerable overlap in the radiologic findings of acute and subacute HP can occur, diffuse homogeneous opacities are usually seen during acute phase, and heterogeneous or small nodular opacities that predominate in mid to lower lung zones are much more common in subacute phase. Characteristic HRCT findings of subacute HP are ground-glass and nodular opacities in a centrilobular distribution, and patchy ground-glass opacity or consolidation. Air trapping on expiratory scan is a helpful ancillary finding, reflecting associated bronchiolitis. In the appropriate clinical setting these findings strongly suggest the diagnosis.

On the CXR taken during the earlier check-up, no specific mass lesions were detected. However, 3 years later, a plain CXR displayed a right lower-paratracheal mass. The patient was an asymptomatic healthy smoker. He had a smoking history of five pack-years. Plain CXR demonstrated a smooth-marginated 2.5 cm × 2 cm lesion in the right lower-paratracheal area. Chest CT showed a 2.5 cm × 2.2 cm, well-defined and homogeneously enhancing mass, in the patient's right upper posterior mediastinum. No evidence of bony erosion of thoracic vertebrae was observed. The tumor was resected completely with no major bleeding. 

     Histologically, the tumor was characterized by well-circumscribed round hemorrhagic soft tissue, measuring 4 cm × 3 cm × 1.5 cm. Microscopically, the mass consisted of large, dilated, blood-filled vessels; all of which were lined by flattened endothelial tissue. These histological findings are consistent with the diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma.","Mediastinal hemangiomas are rare intrathoracic lesions that are well circumscribed, cystic, hemorrhagic tumors which occur in a range of diameters from 2 to 20 cm. They account for less than 0.5% of all mediastinal masses. 

     Mediastinal hemangiomas tend to appear as sharply marginated, circular, or lobular masses on CXR or chest CT images. Chest CT has proven useful with regard to the evaluation of the extent of such lesions and allowing the effects of non-operative therapy to be assessed, or to plan operative interventions. Hemangiomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of well-marginated mediastinal masses that have heterogeneous attenuation on CT scans, show central enhancement after administration of contrast material or contain punctate calcification. Posterior mediastinal hemangiomas sometimes mimic neuroblastomas, which is the most common posterior mediastinal mass in children.

     Mediastinal hemangiomas can be histologically classified into either capillary or cavernous types. Capillary hemangiomas are characterized by a lobular and solid growth pattern and feature dilated small vessels and a marked proliferation of endothelial cells, whereas cavernous hemangiomas tend to manifest as large dilated vascular spaces, with regions exhibiting interstitial inflammatory changes, fibrosis and smooth muscle proliferation. Although the two types of tumors resemble one another with regard to their clinical behavior, they exhibit distinct histo-morphological growth patterns. Cavernous-type tumors do not spontaneously regress, unlike the capillary type. As such, surgical procedures are often necessary for cavernous-type tumors. However, a cautious approach is clearly warranted in children and young adults suffering from mediastinal hemangiomas, as some lesions have been known to occasionally spontaneously regress. Surgical excision constitutes the current treatment of choice. Whenever possible, such hemangiomas should be excised completely. Angiography, then, is quite important with regard to the identification and embolization of major feeding vessels prior to surgery. The angiographic embolization of feeding vessels proved quite effective in minimizing operative blood loss in cases in which total resection is possible. In cases in which radical resection proves difficult, radiation therapy has been employed as a selective treatment modality.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-14-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-14-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-14-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-14-4.jpg']",50,"['correct:4/50', 'diff:14/50', 'semi:8/50']"

Scrub typhus involves multiple organs including the lung, heart and central nervous system and is characterized by focal vasculitis or perivasculitis seceondary to direct endothelial injury.

After receiving antibacterial medication with levofloxacin, the symptom improved and returned back to home. ","The most common legionella species causing human disease is L. pneumophila. This organism can cause both community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia.

Besides, legionella pneumonia occurs more frequently in the immunocompromised patients suffering from various diseases such as AIDS, kidney transplant, and steroid therapy, DM, age older than 50 and so on.

     Although legionella pneumonia does not have specific radiologic features, the most common findings are peripheral patchy consolidations, which usually spreads rapidly. It usually involves more than one lobe and often the bilateral lungs as the disease progresses.

     On CT, according to Kim et al뭩 study, legionella pneumonia can be manifested as multiple pulmonary infiltrates such as lobar consolidation, lobular consolidation mixed with GGOs, and purely GGOs involving the bilateral lungs. Lobar consolidations were fairly common in immunocompromised hosts. Furthermore, cavities commonly occur in patients with high-dose steroid therapy. Whereas, multiple GGOs without consolidations are usually seen in immunocompetent patients.

In other words, all high-lipid nonchylous effusions can be called chyliform or pseudochylous pleural effusions. 

     The precise pathogenesis of chyliform pleural effusions is unknown. The origin of the lipids in these effusions is thought to be degenerating red and white blood cells in the pleural fluid. The process is apparently initiated by pleurisy with thickened and sometimes calcified pleura. The diseased pleura may result in an abnormally slow transfer of cholesterol and other lipids out of the pleural space and lead to the accumulation of cholesterol in the pleural fluid. Tuberculosis is the most common disease associated with the onset of chronic pleurisy that eventually leads to chyliform effusion. Other reported underlying diseases include rheumatoid lung disease, alcoholism, syphilis, diabetes, Meigs syndrome, malignancy, paragonimiasis, and trauma or hemothorax.

     Amyloidosis is a disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid (a protein) in various body tissues. Amyloidosis may occur secondary to recognized predisposing diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, and multiple myeloma. In their absence, it is termed primary.

     Only a few of demonstrable lymph node invovement in amyloidosis have been reported previously. All showed enlargement of the hilar, mediastinal, and/or paratracheal lymph nodes. The rarity of radiographically demonstrable lymph node involvement in amyloidosis causes this entity to be omitted from consideration in cases of lymph node enlargement and/or calcification. In addition, there is nothing diagnostic about these manifestations. Lymph node enlargement is usually bilateral, but may be unilateral. Biopsy of enlarged nodes will only be diagnostic if Congo red staining is performed. Thus, the radiologist is advised to add this entity to the differential diagnosis of lymph node enlargement.

They are lined by ciliated epithelium and have focal areas of hyaline cartilage, smooth muscle, and bronchial glands within their walls.

     Although a majority of bronchogenic cysts is known to arise in the mediastinum, less than a third of bronchogenic cysts have been reported to arise within the lung parenchyma. Intraparenchymal (pulmonary) bronchogenic cyst is usually solitary and appears no different radiologically from bronchogenic cysts arising in the mediastinum ?a sharply defined, uncalcified round or oval density showing homogeneous internal water density. The attenuation of the internal content may be higher owing to higher concentrations of proteinaceous mucus, hemorrhage, calcium, or calcium oxalate. Intraparenchymal bronchogenic cyst may be air-filled or even demonstrate an air-fluid level depending on the presence of communication with an adjacent bronchus. This may explain the relatively higher incidence of infection than in its mediastinal counterpart.

Thin-walled carvernous pulmonary metastases are rarely reported. Generally, neoplastic cavities occur in approximately nine percent of primary and four percent of metastatic pulmonary tumors.
 The pathogenesis of cavitary pulmonary metastasis is controversial. It may be caused by tumor necrosis secondary to inadequate blood supply due to tumor emboli and subsequent evacuation of necrotic tissue into the airway, a mechanism which can explain the pathogenesis of rapidly growing large lesions. The cavitary lesions in the present case, however, were small and on histological examination showed no tumor emboli. As an alternative, the tumor, by extrinsic compression, can cause bronchial obstruction and thus a resulting cystic lesion, along which tumor cells can extend to form tumor cavities.

Note intraluminal partial thrombosis extending from the mass in the left innominate vein.," Malignant lymphoma that involves mainly or exclusively the mediastinum at initial presentation (primary mediastinal lymphoma) is a relatively common condition seen in patients of all ages. Most cases are due to 1 of 3 histologic subtypes: Hodgkin lymphoma, mediastinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. 
 In these early reviewers, some tumors had initially been misdiagnosed as thymomas, seminomas, or anaplastic carcinomas, and considerable overlap of imaging findings between mediastinal lymphomas and other types of anterior mediastinal masses does exist. Masses typically exhibit homogenous soft-tissue attenuation, while large tumors may demonstrate heterogeneity with complex lo low attenuation representing necrosis, hemorrhage, and cystic degeneration, regardless of subtypes of mediastinal lymphoma. 
 The surface lobulation of the main mass is due to involvement of multiple nodes and coalescence, a finding most commonly noted in hodgkin’s lymphoma at CT followed by mediastinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The presence of superior vena cava syndrome has been reported up to 35% of 20 mediastinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Extrathoracic lymphadenopathy including superficial cervical, supraclavicular, submandibular, submental, parotid, mesenteric, and inguinal nodes, was seen in the majority of patients with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in the present study.

 Large-cell lymphomas elsewhere in the body occur as a median age of 52 years and show a 2:1 male to female predominance. Conversely, the median age of patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas is the in the 30s. For this type of lymphoma, a female-to-male predominance of approximately 3:2 has been described. Mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma typically is initially confined to the mediastinum and contiguous nodal areas without showing extrathoracic disease at presentation.

Mucoid impaction of subsegmental bronchi of the posterior basal segment is associated with the lesion.","Inflammatory pseudotumor is a quasineoplastic lesion consisting of inflammatory cells and myofibroblastic spindle cells. Inflammatory pseudotumor most commonly involves the lung and the orbit, but it has been reported to occur in nearly every site in the body, from the central nervous system to the gastrointestinal tract. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor is the most common primary lung mass seen in children, constituting approximately 50% of benign intrapulmonary tumors seen in pediatric patients. These tumors have no sex predilection, and their peak prevalence is in the second decade of life. Cough, fever, dyspnea, and hemoptysis are the usual presenting symptoms. 
On the basis of the predominant histopathologic features, the lesions can be divided into three histologic types: (a) organizing pneumonia pattern, characterized by airways filled with plump fibroblasts and foamy histiocytes and parenchyma replaced with a mixture of histiocytes, mononuclear cells, and fibroblasts; (b) fibrous histiocytic pattern, which is the most common, and is characterized by spindle-shaped myofibroblasts arranged in whorls; and (c) lymphohistiocytic pattern, which is the least common and is characterized by a mixture of lymphocytes and plasma cells with only minimal fibrous connective tissue. 
On radiographs, inflammatory pseudotumor typically appears as a solitary, peripheral, sharply circumscribed, lobulated mass with an anatomic bias for the lower lobes. On CT scans, inflammatory pseudotumors have a variable and nonspecific appearance, but most commonly they appear with heterogeneous attenuation and enhancement. Calcification within the lesion occurs more frequently in children than in adults. The calcification pattern ranges from an amorphous, mixed, or fine fleck-like pattern to heavy mineralization. Cavitation and lymphadenopathy are rare. Atelectasis and pleural effusion may occur. 
When inflammatory pseudotumor are endobronchial in location, they are typically polypoid and may or may not extend beyond the bronchial wall. Endoluminal airway involvement has been known to occur in 10-12% in previous reports. Recently Kim et al. observed that 5 (50%) of 10 patients with inflammatory pseudotumor had major airway involvement. They concluded that inflammatory pseudotumor should be included in the differential diagnosis when a well-defined, polypoid, endotracheal/endobronchial nodule is seen on CT. 
The radiologic differential diagnosis for inflammatory pseudotumor occurring as a solitary pulmonary nodule includes primary or secondary neoplasm, hamartoma, chondroma, hemangioma, granuloma, and pulmonary sequestration. Inflammatory pseudotumor may resemble pulmonary intralobar sequestration in that its blood supply is derived from the systemic arteries. As a endobronchial tumor, inflammatory pseudotumor should be included in differential diagnosis with squamous cell carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, carcinoid tumor, leiomyoma, neurogenic tumor, and hamartoma.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-48-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-48-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-48-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-48-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-48-5.jpg']",49,"['correct:2/49', 'diff:7/49', 'semi:28/49']"

HRCT images show the multifocal patchy ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and reticular opacities at subpleural portion of both lungs.","Nonspecific interstital pneumonia/fibrosis(NSIP) was first described in 1994 as a diagnosis of exclusion. The main pathologic findings is varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis within alveolar walls that are temporally uniform in all sections. It may be patchy and, if so, often shows a peribronchiolar distribution. 
In the original series 46% of patients had possible precipitating events or associated disorder, judged to be significant. These consisted of; (1) in 16% a variety of connective tissue disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, dermato/polymyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, Sj?ren뭩 syndrom); (2) in 5% autoimmune disorders including primary biliary cirrhosis and Hashimoto thyroiditis; (3) in 8% recent surgery/ pneumonia/ ARDS; and (4) in 17% inhalation of possible noxious agents.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are usually bilateral with a basal predominance. They may be consolidation and patch, reticulonodular, or mixed. Other described features include reduced lung volume, pleural effusion (5%), hilar nodes(6%), and normality(6%). Detailed HRCT descriptions are available in 78 patients. A number of findings are described which may occur singly or in combination. The commonest abnormality (80% to 90%) is bilateral, patch ground-glass opacity either symmetrically or diffusely distributed in all zones or displaying a basal predominance. In 50% to 70% of patients it displays a subpleural predilection. Ground glass opacity occurs as an isolated finding in about one-third of patients. Consolidation is seen in 16%to 35% of patients, almost always combined with ground-glass opacity. Like ground-glass opacity, consolidation is bilateral, basal, and subpleurally predominant. Irregular linear opacities, commonly subpleural, occur in about 50% of cases (range 29% to 87%). Honeycomb changes recorded in 28% of patients in one series have been absent in others. Airway are commonly (38% to71%) dilated in areas of consolidation or ground-glass opacity, and Kim and colleagues described thickened bronchovascular bundles in 65% of cases.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-54-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-54-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-54-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-54-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-54-5.jpg']",63,"['correct:4/63', 'diff:20/63', 'semi:31/63']"

Over the past 25 years, the incidence of male breast cancer has risen 26%, from 0.86 to 1.08 per 100,000 population. The mean age of diagnosis is 67 years, and less than 6% of cases occur in males under the age of 40 years. At mammography, these are typically high-density irregular masses with well-defined contours. Margins are usually spiculated, lobulated, or microlobulated. Most are retroareolar since male breast cancers commonly arise from central ducts. They can be distinguished form benign gynecomastia by appearing as a discrete mass, commonly with secondary features. Eccentric location is not typical for benign gynecomastia and is suspicious for carcinoma (1).
The main CT criteria for the diagnosis of malignant breast lesions include irregular-bordered, high-density masses and spicules of dense tissue radiating from such masses into the adjacent mammary tissue. Other signs of malignancy are thickening of the overlying skin, the presence of significantly enlarged dense lymph nodes, invasion of the pectoralis muscle, and pleural effusion. The early, strong enhancement of malignant lesions using rapid bolus intravenous administration of 100 mL of iodine contrast agent for 25 seconds (4 mL/s) on CT has already been reported; however, microcalcifications are usually not recognized on CT (2).
Lung cancer developed mostly (65.6%) in the peripheral portion, where advanced fibrosis predominates. These findings suggest that the occurrence of lung cancer is related to diffuse fibrosis of the lung including IPF.

Human infection results from ingestion of raw freshwater crab or crayfish infected with the metacercaria.
P. westermani excyst in the small intestine, and the larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and enter the peritoneal space. Next they penetrate the diaphragm and pleura and enter the lung in 3? weeks, where they mature to adult flukes.
On chest radiographs, 83% of patients had pulmonary lesions (consolidation, cysts, nodule, and linear opacity) and 61% had pleural lesions (pleural effusion, hydropneumothorax, and pleural thickening).
According to Im et al. the characteristic CT features of paragonimiasis were round low-attenuation cystic lesions (5?5 mm) filled with either fluid or gas, within the consolidation. On CT, air-space consolidation was noted in 82% (14/17), nodules in 41% (7/17), linear opacities extending from the pleura to the lung in 41% (7/17), and bronchiectasis in 35% (6/17).

The constellation of focal pleural thickening and subpleural linear opacities leading to a necrotic peripheral pulmonary nodule is another frequent CT finding of paragonimiasis. Although minimal and easily overlooked, focal fibrotic pleural thickening adjacent to a pulmonary nodule can be an important clue in the diagnosis of pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis on CT.

Two forms are recognized, (1) primary (idiopathic) and (2) secondary (due to lung infections; hematologic malignancies; and inhalation of mineral dusts such as silica, titanium oxide, aluminum, and insecticides). Incidence of PAP is increased in patients with hematologic malignancies and AIDS, suggesting a relationship with immune dysfunction.
Patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) typically present with a gradual onset of symptoms. As many as 30% of patients are asymptomatic, even with diffuse chest radiograph (CXR) abnormalities. Most common symptoms include Persistent dry cough (or scant sputum production) or Persistent dry cough (or scant sputum production).
Serologic studies are generally not useful. Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) remains the criterion standard. Elevated levels of the proteins SP-A and SP-D in serum and BAL fluid may be useful. Elevated titer of neutralizing autoantibody against GM-CSF (immunoglobulin G [IgG] isotype) in serum and BAL fluid may be useful. Recent studies have proposed that deficiency of GM-CSF causes pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP); all patients studied had the antibody to GM-CSF. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is usually elevated, but this finding is nonspecific.
The diagnosis can be made by BAL only if PAS staining is requested. Therefore, PAP is probably underdiagnosed.
CXR shows bilateral perihilar infiltrates with consolidation in a ""bat-wing"" configuration, which may mimic pulmonary edema, although with a typical absence of cardiomegaly or pleural effusion. Unilateral involvement occurs occasionally, and lymphadenopathy is rarely present. Typically, changes progress over weeks to months into a diffuse reticulogranular pattern. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the chest demonstrates areas of patchy ground-glass opacification with smooth interlobular septal thickening and intralobular interstitial thickening, which produces a polygonal pattern referred to as ""crazy paving"".
Management of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) depends on the progression of the illness, coexisting infections, and degree of physiological impairment. The standard of care for PAP is mechanical removal of the lipoproteinaceous material by whole-lung lavage.
In secondary PAP, appropriate treatment of the underlying cause also is warranted.
GM-CSF has been shown to improve PAP in several patients and is being investigated.

Echocardiographic findings suggested infiltrative disease such as amyloidosis and chest CT with concentric low density along the endocardium supported cardiac involvement of systemic amyloidosis.","   Systemic disease is due to the deposition of mainly (92%) AL proteins in multiple organs. Respiratory tract involvement is common but rarely produces symptoms of clinical importance, and may be difficult to distinguish from symptoms due to cardiac involvement. Prognosis is poor, with a 5 year survival rate of, 20%, and is worse in those cases associated with multiple myeloma. Systemic amyloidosis is diagnosed by positive staining (with Congo Red) of abdominal fat samples (positive in 80%), bone marrow aspirate (50% positive), or rectal biopsy (80% positive).
   Both mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy are common in AL-type systemic amyloidosis (75% of patients in the Mayo Clinic series), but rare in localized disease. It is usually associated with parenchymal disease (50%) but may be a solitary finding, and calcification may be present.
   It may be possible to distinguish between systemic and localized respiratory tract amyloidosis based on the thoracic CT findings alone. Lymphadenopathy and the diffuse alveolar septal pattern of parenchymal disease both suggest systemic disease, as they are rare in the localized form.
   The heart is the most commonly involved organ in the chest, usually caused by the AL subtypes, rarely by the AA form. Virtually all parts of the heart can be involved, including not only the myocardium, the interatrial septum and atrial walls but also the valve leaflets. Increased thickness of the myocardial wall, caused by increased interstitial amyloidal deposition, leads to systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and cardiac arrhythmias. Although cardiac biopsy can reliably diagnose cardiac amyloidosis, its procedural risks and uncertainty about sampling errors limit its applications. Currently cardiac ultrasound is considered the non-invasive test of choice to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis. Due to the amyloidal deposition, the myocardium has a granular or speckled appearance on cardiac ultrasound. Recently, several groups, using the inversion-recovery contrast-enhanced MRI technique, have described patterns of myocardial enhancement that seem to be unique for cardiac amyloidosis. Maceira and co-workers described a “zebra pattern” consisting of a strong subendocardial and subepicardial late enhancement, involving both the right and left ventricle.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-604-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-604-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-604-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-604-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-604-5.jpg']",41,"['correct:6/41', 'diff:12/41', 'semi:18/41']"

 A Pathologic report revealed polymorphic posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
 The result of EBV in situ hybridization was positive.","   Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is defined as an abnormal proliferation of lymphocytes, usually of B-cell origin, occurring in patients receiving immunosuppressants following organ or bone marrow transplantation. The disorder is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. The estimated prevalence of PTLD in pediatric transplant recipients (4%) is higher than that in adults (0.8%). Under current immunotherapy regimens, PTLD may develop as early as 1 month after transplantation, but the median time from transplantation to diagnosis was reported as 4.4 months. 
   The Epstein-Barr virus infects B lymphocytes and stimulates their proliferation. The cytotoxic T lymphocytes that control B-cell proliferation in the healthy host are suppressed in the transplant recipient by agents such as cyclosporine-A, FK-506, and muromonab-CD3. This pathogenetic sequence undergirds the rationale for PTLD treatment, which is resection of tumor bulk and reduction of immunosuppression.
   The histologic characteristics and immunocytochemistry of PTLD help guide therapy and gauge prognosis. Polymorphous, polyclonal tumors tend to regress spontaneously after immunosuppression has been reduced, but monomorphous, monoclonal tumors are more apt to behave like typical non-Hodgkin lymphoma and may require specific chemotherapy. Widely disseminated PTLD usually portends a fatal outcome. Treatment with acyclovir is directed toward the Epstein-Barr viral infection. Use of anti-B-cell monoclonal antibodies may be effective in selected patients.
   The imaging features are similar to other lymphomas. CT may reveal retroperitoneal, mesenteric, mediastinal, or peripheral adenopathy or masses. Nodules in the liver, spleen, or kidneys are characteristically homogeneous and well-defined. Lung parenchymal involvement typically consists of discrete pulmonary nodules.

Wedge resection of the nodule revealed chronic granulomatous inflammation.  Special stain revealed Cryptococcus.,"   Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous fungus found worldwide, particularly in soil contaminated by pigeon droppings. Cryptococcal infection usually results from inhalation of organisms; dependent on host immune status, the infection may remain isolated to the lungs or undergo hematogenous spread to involve the CNS, bones, and skin. Pulmonary cryptococcosis occurs rarely in immunocompetent individuals. Defects in cellular immune function predispose to infection, with susceptible patient groups including those with HIV infection, lymphoma, leukemia, malignancy, and drug-induced immunosuppression. The most common manifestation of pulmonary cryptococcosis on CT was pulmonary nodules. Nodules were typically 5-20 mm in diameter, smoothly marginated, either solitary or multiple in number, and associated with other parenchymal findings such as masses and consolidation. Cavitation in nodules and masses has been previously described as a radiographic feature particularly in immunosuppressed patients.
   Ground-glass opacities adjacent to or surrounding nodules in an appearance consistent with the CT halo sign were present in 40% of patients presenting with a nodular pattern of disease. The CT halo sign was first used by Kuhlman et al. to describe the CT appearance of hemorrhagic nodules due to invasive aspergillosis; subsequently, this sign has been shown to occur in association with hemorrhagic nodules of varying causes as well as some nonhemorrhagic infections such as coccidioidomycosis and actinomycosis. In patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis and the CT halo sign, histologic correlation showed the ground-glass opacities to represent granulomatous inflammation.
   The radiologic manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis are thought to be affected by the patient's level of immunosuppression. Prior radiographic and CT  studies of cryptococcal pneumonia in AIDS patients have shown that in contrast to the nodular patterns most common in the HIV-seronegative population, interstitial-type patterns predominate in HIV-seropositive patients.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-607-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-607-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-607-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-607-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-607-5.jpg']",55,"['correct:11/55', 'diff:13/55', 'semi:23/55']"

It was originally described by Moritz Kaposi, an Austro-Hungarian dermatologist practicing at theUniversity of Vienna in 1872. It became more widely known as one of the AIDS defining illnesses in the 1980s. Radiographic findings in diffuse KS comprise 2 major patterns, ie, linear interstitial nodules and fluffy ill-defined nodules. Coexistence of the 2 patterns is not uncommon. A tendency toward a perihilar distribution has been observed. This reflects the bronchovascular-centric nature of the disease, with characteristic thickening along bronchovascular bundles. The thickening becomes more nodular with tumor progression, with eventual confluence of poorly marginated nodules leading to dense airspace consolidation. The middle and lower portions of the lungs are affected more frequently than the upper zones. Classically, nodules are described as flame-shaped or spiculated. They typically measure 1-2 cm in diameter and frequently number more than 10. Septal lines may be seen as a result of lymphatic obstruction or tumor invasion. In patients with KS, characteristic CT findings correlate with chest radiograph appearances, with bronchial wall thickening, ill-defined nodules, and areas of consolidation in a perihilar bronchocentric distribution. Frequently, the nodules are seen to be surrounded by a ground-glass opacity halo representing localized hemorrhage (CT halo sign). Interlobular septal thickening is a common feature seen on HRCT.

Human disease is acquired by contact with urine or tissues of an infected animal or through contaminated water or soil. Systemic infection of leptospirosis shows variable clinical symptoms and signs from indolent and fatal manifestation with multi-organ failure. 
Leptospirosis can be complicated by ARDS, which needs the treatment of underlying disease and adequate supportive care with artificial mechanical ventilation. 
The main causes of the disease, we believe, are heavy rain and water flooding during the summer, which leads to wide propagation of Leptospira. 
Leptospirosis can occur as two clinical manifestations: 
1) a self-limiting anicteric systemic illness, which occurs in 85-90 % of the disease, and 2) a septicemic leptospirosis, 10-15 % of patients.
Systemic leptospirosis is characterized by abrupt onset of chills, fever, headache, and myalgia. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can occur occasionally. 
Weil's disease, icteric leptospirosis, is the severest form of the disease and characterized by the presence of impaired renal and hepatic function, multi-organ internal hemorrhage, vascular collapse, and severe alteration in consciousness. 
Pneumonia occurs in one fifth to two thirds of patients with leptospirosis. Im et al. reviewed the chest radiographic findings in 37 patients of 58 serologically proven leptospirosis, who had the positive radiographic findings, with pathologic correlation by experimental study. Three radiographic patterns were evident: (1) 21 (57%) of the 37 patients had small nodular densities, (2) six (16%) had large confluent areas of consolidation, and (3) 10 (27%) had diffuse, ill-defined, ground-glass density. Serial radiographs showed a tendency for the nodular pattern to be followed by confluent consolidation and/or ground-glass opacity, as this case. Abnormalities were bilateral, nonlobar in all cases, and had a marked tendency toward peripheral predominance.

   The mass shows relatively homogenous attenuation with contrast enhancement. 
   Axial FDG-PET image demonstrates increased FDG uptake corresponding to the mass on the CT images. ","   Castleman disease, also known as angiofollicular hyperplasia or giant lymph node hyperplasia, is a rare disorder of lymphoid tissue. This disease may occur anywhere along the lymphatic chain but it is most commonly found as a solitary mass in the mediastinum. 
   Two distinct histologic patterns of Castleman disease have been described, including the hyaline-vascular type, accounting for 90% of cases, and the remainder of cases as the plasma cell type, which is often associated with constitutional symptoms. 
   Three patterns have been reported on CT or MRI, including a solitary noninvasive mass (50%), like the present case, a dominant infiltrative mass with associated lymphadenopathy (40%), and a matted lymphadenopathy without a dominant mass (10%). 
   In Castleman disease, CT with contrast material usually shows a dense uniform enhancement. Dynamic CT demonstrates early rapid enhancement and washout in the delayed phase, which are considered as typical imaging characteristics that help to differentiate this disease from other mediastinal tumors, furthermore, peripheral hypervascularity is a characteristic finding on power Doppler ultrasonography. A punctate or arborizing pattern of calcification may be seen. 
   Some recent studies have reported a considerable number of cases showing heterogeneous attenuation. They reported that tumors greater than 5 cm in diameter generally demonstrate heterogeneous enhancement. In several studies, a focal low attenuation area within the mass showing delayed enhancement on dynamic CT or MRI, was pathologically proven to be central stellate fibrosis interspersed within the mass. 
   An MRI study has been reported to be useful for the evaluation of peripheral or tumoral hypervascularity and the relationship with adjacent vascular structures, because vascular structures appear signal void with high contrast to the mass.

MR images show ovoid mass-like lesion of T2/T1 dark signal intensity without enhancement at the resection site of the left ribs.","   Plombage was a surgical method used prior to the introduction of anti-tuberculosis drug therapy to treat cavitary tuberculosis of the upper lobe of the lung. The term derives from the French word ""Plomb"" (lead) and refers to the insertion of an inert substance in the pleural space. The technical medical term for plombage is Extraperiosteal/Extrapleural Pneumonolysis. The underlying theory of Plombage treatment was the belief that if the diseased lobe of the lung was physically forced to collapse, it would heal quickly. Collapse therapy with plombage has been proposed in the early 1950s in patients with persistent cavitary disease despite specific antimycobacterial drug therapy. This technique consisted of denuding the ribs overlying the diseased area, collapsing selectively the parenchymal cavities - the major sources of bacillary proliferation - and maintaining the collapse by filling the subcostal extraperiostal space with a ""plomb. A variety of substances were typically used as a “plomb” and included air, olive or mineral oil, gauze, paraffin wax, rubber sheeting or bags and Lucite balls. The inserted material would force the upper lobe of the lung to collapse. Compared with staged extrapleural thoracoplasty from which it is descended, the major advantages of this procedure were as follows: (1) collapse was obtained with only one operation; (2) it did not cause any physical deformity; (3) it was applicable to poor risk patients; (4) it preserved lung function; (5) it was applicable to bilateral disease; (6) hospital stay was short; (7) it markedly reduced postoperative complications. When practiced, this procedure cured up to three-fourths of the patients but was abandoned after a few years, as were other surgical procedures, when the improvements of antimycobacterial chemotherapy made it sufficient to cure almost all of the patients. Complications after collapse therapy with plombage reported in the 1950s included basically local infection and mediastinal compression. The latter should be avoided by using a number of plombs just necessary to collapse the underlying cavities. More recent reports have related late local complications resulting from plombage inserted up to 40 yr earlier, including ","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-619-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-619-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-619-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-619-4.jpg']",43,"['correct:40/43', 'diff:1/43', 'semi:6/43']"

 Sclerotic change is seen at the upper and lower end plates of T-spine . 

 Surgical exploration of the neck showed parathyroid mass, which was confirmed to be parathyroid adenoma. ","   Excessive production of PTH, termed hyperparathyroidism is classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary in form. Primary hyperparathyroidism, due to autonomous hypersecretion of PTH, usually occurs in the setting of a parathyroid adenoma (80%) but can also be seen with parathyroid gland hyperplasia (15%?20%) or carcinoma (0.5%). Secondary hyperparathyroidism results from stimulation of the parathyroid glands as a response to hypocalcemia or due to apparent insensitivity of the parathyroid glands to elevated serum calcium levels and dysregulation of the normal negative feedback loop (pseudohypoparathyroidism). Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is seen in cases of secondary hyperparathyroidism in which the parathyroid glands continue to function autonomously despite correction of the initial cause, resulting in hypersecretion of PTH in the setting of normal calcium levels. 

   The classic imaging features of advanced primary hyperparathyroidism are also less frequently seen today. Generalized osteopenia is the most common imaging finding in primary hyperparathyroidism. Only very rarely encountered in primary hyperparathyroidism, diffuse or localized osteosclerosis is a more common finding in secondary hyperparathyroidism. When involving the spine, sclerosis can produce a striped appearance, the so-called ?rugger jersey? spine. Subperiosteal bone resorption is a common finding of advanced hyperparathyroidism, most often seen involving the hands and the feet. 

  Other areas of bone resorption are seen at sites of high bone surface area and include subchondral locations, often best appreciated at the sacroiliac, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, and temporomandibular joints, the symphysis pubis, and the patella. Resorption of subligamentous and subtendinous bone occurs most often at the femoral trochanters, the ischial tuberosities, the calcaneal insertions of the plantar aponeurosis and Achilles tendon, the inferior margin of the distal clavicle, and the tuberosities of the humerus. Intracortical, endosteal, and trabecular bone resorption can also be present. Brown tumors, also known as osteoclastomas, are eccentrically located and often expansile lesions resulting from amassing osteoclasts and fibrous tissue. Chondrocalcinosis is a nonspecific finding that has a higher prevalence in primary rather than secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although also having a higher prevalence in primary hyperparathyroidism, brown tumors are more frequently encountered in the setting of secondary hyperparathyroidism due to the greater prevalence of this condition.

Surgical exploration was done, and this mass was confirmed to be solitary fibrous tumor of pleura.
Gross specimen revealed firm and solid in central portion with hypervascularity and soft and myxoid in peripheral portion with hypovascularity. ","Solitary fibrous tumor of pleura (SFTP) is a slow growing and primary pleural neoplasm, not associated with asbestosis and smoking exposure. Incidence is fewer than 5% of pleural tumors. This tumor showed wide age range (5-87 years), but predominantly occurs in the sixth and seventh decades with equal frequency of sex. Common symptoms of SFTP are cough, chest pain, or dyspnea. But many patients (43~67%) are asymptomatic. Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy is the most common paraneoplastic syndrome of this tumor. Hypolycemia is rare and usually associated with large tumors. SFTP appears to arise from mesenchymal cells subjacent to the mesenchymal lined pleura and is composed of haphazardly arranged fascicles of elongated spindle cells separated by variable amounts of collagen. Myxoid or cystic degeneration may occur in this tumor, which is seen to be low density on CT. Most SFTP is benign (80~90%), and malignant tumors commonly have hemorrhage, necrosis, myxomatous change, and vascular or stromal invasion.
Radiologic finding of SFTP is nonspecific. SFTP predominates in the middle and lower half of chest. CT shows well defined and often lobulated mass. Nonenhancing areas correspond to necrosis, myxoid degeneration, or hemorrhage. Well enhancing area is a result of rich vascular tissue of mass. Large tumors show more heterogenous nature. Calcifications are principally noted in large tumors. Malignant tumors have tendency to show sessile and large mass (>10cm), atypical location, necrosis, and hemorrhage. MRI is often useful in evaluating chest wall invasion.
Percutanous transthoracic needle biopsy of SFTP is questionable because success rate is low (43%) and biopsy does not influence the need for surgery. Bronchoscopy or sputum cytology is not helpful.  Tumor recurrence is low in benign pedunculated tumors (2%) and high in malignant sessile tumors (63%).
In conlusion, SFTP should be considered in solitary mass abutting the pleura, which have lower thoracic location, sharp contour, lobulation, obtuse angle to chest wall, or mobility of mass.

",Anomalous left brachiocephalic vein,"Posteroanterior chest radiograph show an abnormal course of left central venous catheter. CT images reveal anomalous, left brachiocephalic vein (asterisk) located between ascending aorta and trachea as it crosses midline, passing below aortic arch with drainage into superior vena cava at level slightly lower than entry of azygos arch (Figure 2)","The reported prevalence of an anomalous brachiocephalic vein is 0.2-1.7 %. 
Presence of a right-sided aortic arch and underdeveloped pulmonary artery are significantly more common in patients with an anomalous brachiocephalic vein than in those without. 
The exact embryogenesis of this anomaly remains unknown. 
Pattern definitions are as described by Takada et al. Ten anomalous brachiocephalic vein subpatterns were recognized on the basis of the relationship between the anomalous brachiocephalic vein and adjacent vessel anomalies. Most of cases were pattern b, which incorporated anomalous brachiocephalic veins crossing the midline beneath the aortic arch, above the pulmonary artery, and in front of a patent ductal arteriosus or ligamentum arteriosus. 
To the radiologist, the descending portion of an anomalous brachiocephalic vein must be differentiated from a persistent left superior vena cava, an ascending vertical vein in a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and a left partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. The middle portion needs to be differentiated from the central pulmonary artery. The retroaortic crossing segment of the anomalous brachiocephalic vein may be misinterpreted on unenhanced CT as an enlarged lymph node, an elevated right pulmonary artery in patients with hypoplastic or atretic central pulmonary arteries, or an early branching right upper lobe pulmonary artery on cross-sectional echocardiography. Carefully tracing this vascular channel through sequential images is the key to differentiation.

","Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is characterized by proliferation of abnormal appearing smooth muscle cells (LAM cells) in the lungs, the kidneys, and the lymphatic system. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hamartomas, seizures, and mental retardation. TSC is caused by mutation of two genes, TSC1 or TSC2; its occurrence can be sporadic (approximately 60% of cases) or inherited. Up to a third of women with TSC may exhibit lung cysts, the hallmark feature of LAM; these patients have been categorized as having TSC/LAM.

The same set of findings (lung cysts, renal and hepatic angiomyolipomas (AMLs) comprises the CT features of both sporadic LAM and TSC/LAM; however, the frequency and severity with which they occur differ between the two groups. Hepatic and renal AMLs and lung nodules are more common in TSC/LAM, while lymphatic involvement뾲horacic duct dilatation, chylous pleural effusion, and ascites뾦s more common in LAM. These results appear to be relatively independent of age in adult patients. 

Noncalcified pulmonary nodules likely represent a multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia, which was initially described in patients with TSC/LAM. These benign noncalcified pulmonary nodules range in size from 2 mm to 1 cm and are distributed randomly in the lungs; they are composed of thickened fibrotic alveolar septa lined by pleomorphic type II pneumocytes. The absence of immunohistochemical staining for HMB45 (stains smooth muscle cells, or ""LAM cells,"" diagnostic for LAM) suggests a histogenesis separate from the lesions in LAM.

There is no single diagnostic test for AOSD, and diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and usually necessitates the exclusion of infectious, neoplastic and autoimmune diseases.  

Adult Still’s disease is defined as the clinical and biological signs: 
- fever > higher than 39°C;
- joint pain and swelling;
- skin rash on the trunk and limbs during the fever spikes;
- muscle pain;
- sore throat, corresponding pharyngitis;
- palpable lymph nodes;
- leukocytosis, especially neutrophils;
- biological hepatitis, elevated AST/SGOT;
- elevated ferritin, useful finding for orienting the diagnosis;
- no sign of autoimmunity in the blood;
- no microbial agent in throat swabs.

In our case, clinical findings include fever, sputum, joint pain and swelling, skin rash (6 month ago), palpable lymph nodes on the neck, leukocytosis (18400) and elevated neutrophils (95%), elevated AST/ALT(247/83), elevated ferritin (>2000), LDH (2720), elevated ESR, AIT (-), DNAT (-), ANCAT (-), C3/C4 80/25, normocytic normochromic anemia

The major radiographic abnormalities of AOSD are multiple cervical, mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, joint swelling, pericardial effusion. Differential diagnosis of multiple lymphadenopathy include lymphoma, tuberculosis, infectious disease, neoplastic disease, Kikuchi disease, etc.

The diagnosis of AOSD could be applied most confidently to an illness of adults in which fever, skin rash, remission of multiple lymphadenopathy, joint swelling, pericardial effusion and/or pleural effusion as well as specific laboratory findings of leukocytosis, elevated ferritin, elevated LDH, and elevated AST/ALT.  

Treatment includes the use of corticosteroids, often in combination with immunosuppressants (e.g. methotrexate, gold, azathioprine, leflunomide, tacrolimus, ciclosporin and cyclophosphamide) and intravenous immunoglobulin. Biological agents (e.g. anti-TNFα, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6) have been successfully used in refractory cases.

CT scan obtained with lung window setting shows multiple linear opacities perpendicular to the pleural surface that correspond to transpleural systemic vessels.,"Proximal interruption of the right or left pulmonary artery is an uncommon developmental anomaly. The term interruption is used in preference to absence of a pulmonary artery, since the portion of the vessel that is in the lung is usually intact and patent. Blood is supplied to the lung through collateral systemic vessels, mainly bronchial arteries but also transpleural branches of the intercostal, internal mammary, subclavian, and innominate arteries. Interruption of the left pulmonary artery is usually associated with a right aortic arch and other congenital cardiovascular anomalies. Right pulmonary artery interruption is more common than left, and it is an isolated finding in most instances. 

Chest radiographs typically show a volume loss in the hemithorax. In patients with enlarged intercostal and transpleural arteries, fine linear opacities are seen at the periphery of the lung. On CT scans, the mediastinal portion of the affected pulmonary artery may be completely absent or may terminate within 1 cm of its origin. Serrated thickening of the pleura and subpleural parenchymal bands also may appear on CT scans and may be attributable to direct anastomosis of transpleural collateral vessels with peripheral branches of the pulmonary artery.

Figure 3. There are multiple masses in all phalanges and some of them developed to chondrosarcomas. 
Figure 4. Chrondrosarcoma also developed in both pelvic bones.   ","The enchondroma is a tumor that develops in the medullary cavity and is composed of lobules of hyaline cartilage. Typical sites of involvement are the humerus, femur, and tibia. Rare areas of skeletal localization are the skull, facial bones, patella. clavicle, sternum, scapula, ulna and vertebrae. The enchondromas in the ribs may lead to osseous expansion, designated as enchondroma protuberans, that simulates the appearance of an osteochondroma, or to massive enlargement of the bone. The radiographic appearance of enchondromas is usually characteristic. A well-defined, medullary lesion with some degree of calcification, a lobulated contour, and endosteal erosion allow precise diagnosis in most cases. Cortical expansion or thickening and pathologic fracture are other potential radiographic characteristics. 

Chondroid lesions of the ribs are always seen at or near the anterior end of the rib. Therefore, lesions at the costochondral junction, especially if calcified, are suggestive of a chondroid origin. Enchondroma, which cause focal expansion of the rib, may be seen and may be diagnosed if typical chondroid calcification-“rings and arcs” pattern-can be demonstrated.

Enchondromatosis (Ollier’s disease) is rare and nonhereditary, consisting of multiple, asymmetrically distributed intraosseous cartilaginous foci and subperiosteal deposition of cartilage, either exclusively or predominantly involving one side of the body; the affected bones are often shortened and deformed.

It is seen most frequently in children and young adults but has been estimated to cause more than 15% of pneumonia in patients older than 40 years. The principal histologic abnormality is bronchiolitis, similar in appearance to that caused by viruses. Extension of infection and the concomitant inflammatory reaction into the parenchyma adjacent to the airways results in pneumonia [1]. 

The radiographic findings in mycoplasma pneumonia are nonspecific and in some cases closely resemble those seen in children with viral infections of the lower respiratory tract. Hazy or ground-glass consolidations frequently occur, but dense homogeneous consolidations like those seen with bacterial pneumonias are uncommon [2]. And it was reported that adult group showed diffuse and/or multifocal, centrilobular or peribronchovascular areas of ground-glass attenuation with a lobular distribution and frequent thickening of the bronchial walls and interlobular septa were demonstrated in adult group[3].

Although manifestations of mycoplasma infection are usually confined to the respiratory tract, a wide variety of extrarespiratory manifestations can also occur, including more severe associated diseases such as myocarditis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and cerebral arteriovenous occlusion [2].

The two theories entertained for the development of pulmonary endometriosis are microembolization and peritoneal-pleural migration. In the microembolization theory, it is postulated that endometrial tissue can be transported through the lymphatic or vascular channels to the lung parenchyma. Alternatively, endometrial tissue may involve the pleura by migrating from the peritoneal cavity to the pleural cavity through diaphragmatic defects. Pleural lesions are almost exclusively right-sided, whereas lung lesions have no such predilection. Regardless of pathophysiology, pulmonary endometriosis is generally associated with coexistent pelvic endometriosis and usually occurs 5 years after the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis. Notably, however, in some cases pulmonary lesions may actually represent embolic decidua or trophoblastic tissue and are not from preexisting endometriosis. 

Reported CT findings of pulmonary endometriosis include ill-defined opacities several centimeters in size, nodules, areas of consolidation or ground glass opacity surrounding the nodules, thin-walled cavities, and bullae.

Rib lesions usually involve the anterior rib at the costochondral junction and show osseous expansile remodeling with a ring-and-arc pattern of calcification and soft-tissue extension on both radiographs and CT. 

The soft tissue component frequently reveals typical punctuate or ring-and-arc matrix mineralization and a lobular growth pattern. The nonmineralized components, both intraosseous and extraosseous, typically have low attenuation on CT scans, reflecting the high water content of hyaline cartilage. CT performed after intravenous administration of contrast material demonstrates mild peripheral rim and septal enhancement. Higher-grade lesions may show higher CT attenuation, similar to that of muscle, and more prominent diffuse or nodular contrast enhancement, caused by increased cellularity and resultant reduced water content.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-661-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-661-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-661-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-661-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-661-5.jpg']",77,"['correct:28/77', 'diff:22/77', 'semi:3/77']"

Historically, they have been divided into the abdominal, extraabdominal and intra-abdominal. Extraabdominal desmoid tumors chiefly involve the chest wall, shoulder, thigh and neck. Thoracic desmoid tumors occur most frequently in the intercostal muscle, usually after trauma, previous mastectomy, and excision of a neurofibroma.

The imaging appearance of these tumors depends on the relative amounts of fibroblast proliferation, fibrosis, collagen content, and vascularity of the tumor.

At CT, the masses are either ill-defined or well circumscribed. Before contrast material is administered, the tumors show variable attenuation, relative to muscle. After contrast material is administered, they may or may not appear enhanced. Usually, the lesions demonstrate higher attenuation than adjacent muscles.

Tissue from lung, right upper lobe, aspiration cytology;
Atypical squamous cells embedded in inflammatory background; the latter is mainly polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lymphocytes and epitheloid histiocytes; 
tuberculoma is the most probable diagnosis.
","Tuberculoma is a round or oval granuloma caused by acid-fast bacilli, encapsulated by connective tissue [1]. The pathogenesis of tuberculomas is controversial. They may result from a bronchial infection that has been localized and sealed off. A healed, filled-in cavity and a rounded-off,contracted healing tuberculous lesion are the reported possible mechanisms of tuberculoma formation [1,2].

The tuberculomas on CT scans are usually regular and smooth in outline but may have a rough edge. Cavitation in the lesion or surrounding satellite nodule(s) can be seen on CT scans. The lesions are usually low in attenuation and show no or minimal enhancement with administration of contrast medium [3]. Calcification in the tuberculomas is found in 20-30% of the lesions and is usually nodular and diffuse [4]. Rarely, tuberculoma appears with a CT halo sign (halo of ground-glass attenuation surrounding the nodule) in patients with hemoptysis [5]. 

In recent report about HRCT findings in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis correlating with the degree of smear positivity, a significant difference was found for scores of GGO between smear-positive and smear-negative PTB patients [6]. They also found that a significant correlation between GGO score and the degree of smear positivity, which is compatible with previous studies [7]. GGO in PTB might reflect nonspecific inflammatory change adjacent to an area of consolidation. Even though, this finding may be considered as a significant indicator of tuberculous activity, some reports suggest that GGO might be seen as a sign of insufficient treatment [8].","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-672-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-672-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-672-3.jpg']",84,"['correct:7/84', 'diff:38/84', 'semi:37/84']"

The mass extended at the level of the supraaortic arch and encase the stomach carina and esophagus. The trachea and main bronchi were not disturbed and the lungs were clear. The esophageal and rectal masses were low density to skeletal muscle and did not show significant intravenous contrast enhancement.","Smooth muscle tumors comprise approximately 1% of all tumors of the gastrointestinal tract [1]; 66% occur in the stomach, 24% in the small bowel, 7% in the esophagus and 2% in the colon [2]. Multiple lesions are rare, occurring in less than 2.4% of cases. 

Leiomyomata are the most common benign neoplasms of the esophagus but are still infrequent in comparison to malignant tumors of this organ [3]. Twenty-five cases have been described in children [4]. Esophageal leiomyoma are most commonly found in the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus, because the muscularis propria is composed of smooth muscle in this portion of the esophagus. Although solitary tumors are more common in older individuals and present as discrete ovoid masses, the rare multifocal leiomyomas and diffuse leiomyomatosis are more likely to be seen in children and younger adults [5]. Anorectal leiomyomatosis is exceedingly rare in the pediatric population, having previously been documented in only a few cases [6, 7, 8]. There is a recognized association between esophageal leiomyomatosis and Alport's syndrome (hematuric nephritis, neurosensorial deafness, congenital cataracts) [9, 10].

Aspergillus species grow from percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy  at consolidation of LLL.","This type is the chronic granulomatous form of aspergillosis, arising in the setting of mild immunologic compromise and being a progressive form of localized disease. This unusual form of pulmonary aspergillosis resembles clinically a number of other chronic pulmonary diseases including tuberculosis, actinomycosis, histoplasmosis (1).

The patients are usually middle-aged and have poor nutrition due to alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, chronic granulomatous disease or connective tissue disorders. Pulmonary abnormalities resulting in lowered defense mechanisms of the lung such as fibrotic area of mycobacterial infection, chronic obstructive lung disease, previous surgery, radiation therapy, pulmonary infarction or pneumoconiosis may be associated (2).

Clinical symptoms include cough, sputum, fever, weight loss, and hemoptysis, usually persisting at least for a few months. This time course is different from that of invasive aspergillosis (IPA) in which the rate of progression depends on the degree of immunosuppression of host (usually two or three weeks). 

Gefter et al (3) reviewed radiographic findings of semi-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in five patients. They appeared as consolidation or progressing cystic infiltrate subsequently forming a thick-walled cavity and aspergilloma with upper lobe predominance. And pleural thickening was frequently seen.

According to Kim et al (4) in a review of six cases of semi-invasive aspergillosis, the CT findings of the disease were diverse ranging from findings of bronchopneumonia to cavitary consolidation containing an aspergilloma. Main feature distinguishing chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis from aspergilloma is the presence of obvious tissue invasion and destruction in the former. Whereas, pulmonary aspergilloma usually forms within preexisting cavity without tissue invasion. Pathologically, the findings of angioinvasion are lacking which are characteristic in IPA. 

Treatment option depends on the clinical status of the patients; from observation in asymptomatic patients to antifungal therapy or surgical resection in patients with hemoptysis or progressing disease.

It seems that the aortic arch and the aneurysm cause posterior indentation and anterior displacement of the trachea.","In 1936, Kommerell reported an aberrant right subclavian artery arising from the descending thoracic aorta of left aortic arch and associated with persistence of a remnant of the right dorsal aorta. The latter appeared as a diverticulum from which the aberrant right subclavian artery originated. This is known as the diverticulum of Kommerell. An aberrant right subclavian artery with a leftsided aortic arch is the most common of the anomalies involving the subclavian artery (1).

In adults, a right-sided aortic arch cause symptoms of early atherosclerotic changes of the anomalous vessels, dissection, or aneurysmal dilatation with compression of surrounding structures (i.e, dysphagia, dyspnea, stridor, wheezing, cough, choking spells, recurrent pneumonia, obstructive emphysema, or chest pain)(2).

Aneurysm associated with right-sided arch cause rupture or dissection up to 53%. Because of the relative rarity of the condition and the limited information available, rupture cannot be predicted by size. Aggressive treatment may be suggested for aneurysms of 3 cm or greater in diameter. Kommerell's aneurysms associated with a right-sided aortic arch may be repaired through a right thoracotomy and atriofemoral bypass(2).",['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-678-1.jpg'],86,"['correct:33/86', 'semi:29/86']"

They are divided into Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and further subdivisions depend on the histologic types. The presence and distribution of thoracic involvement are important in both tumor staging and treatment, especially when radiation therapy is planned. Intrathoracic involvement is commoner in HL than NHL. Although HL represents only 10% to 15% of all cases of lymphomas, approximately 85% of patients with HL have intrathoracic disease at presentation. NHL represents about 85% to 90% of all cases of lymphoma and approximately 40% to 45% of patients with NHL have intrathoracic disease at the initial presentation. Although HL and NHL may have overlapping imaging findings, there are some significant differences in their radiologic features. 

 NHL has a worse prognosis than HD. Unlike HD, which commonly spreads through contiguous groups of lymph nodes, NHL is infrequently localized at the time of diagnosis and frequently involves extranodal sites of disease. NHL can be divided into two groups: indolent lymphomas, which grow more slowly and have fewer symptoms (eg, follicular lymphoma, MALT), and aggressive lymphomas, which grow more quickly (eg, diffuse large cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, Mantle cell lymphoma). 

 Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas, accounting for up to 30 percent of newly diagnosed cases. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is an aggressive, or fast-growing lymphoma. It can arise in lymph nodes or outside of the lymphatic system, in the gastrointestinal tract, testes, thyroid, skin, breast, bone or brain. Often, the first sign of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a painless or even painful rapid swelling in the neck, armpit or groin caused by enlarged lymph nodes. Other symptoms include night sweats, unexplained fevers and weight loss.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-679-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-679-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-679-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-679-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-679-5.jpg']",74,"['correct:30/74', 'diff:17/74', 'semi:2/74']"

Esophageal perforations usually occur as 1 to 4cm, vertically oriented linear tears on the left posterolateral wall of the distal esophagus just above the esophagogastric junction. The distal esophagus is most vulnerable because of the lack of supporting mediastinal structures in this region and left side of esophagus is more vulnerable because right side of esophagus is protected by descending thoracic aorta.

These finding show no significant interval changes for 2 months.","Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma represents 1.5%-6.5% of all primary pulmonary neoplasm. As with other adenocarcinomas, the prevalence of BAC is relatively high in women (30%-50% of BAC occur in women). Only 255-50% if patients with BAC have a history of heavy smoking. More than half of all patients with BAC are asymptomatic. The most frequent symptoms and signs are cough, sputum, shortness of breath, weight loss, hemoptysis, and fever (1). 

According to the classification of the WHO, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma is a subtype of adenocarcinoma. BAC can be defined as a peripheral neoplasm, arising beyond a recognizable
bronchus, with a tendency to spread locally using the lung structure as a stroma (lepidic growth). BAC can be classified into two main types: mucinous (80%) and nonmucinous. Mucinous BAC is more likely to be multicentric and has s worse prognosis than nonmucinous BAC (1). 

Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma appears radiographically as a single nodule, segmental or lobar consolidation, or diffuse nodules. At computed tomography (CT), the single nodular form appears
as a peripheral nodule or localized ground-glass attenuation with or without consolidation, frequently associated with bubblelike areas of low attenuation and open bronchus signs. The lobar consolidative form may demonstrate the CT angiogram and open bronchus signs. The diffuse nodular form appears as multiple nodules or areas of ground-glass attenuation or consolidation (1). 

The radiological feature that distinguishes BAC from other cell types is the demonstration of multifocal and lobar pneumonic opacities. The consolidative form of BAC accounts for approximately 30% of all BAC and corresponds to a mucinous histological subtype. Non-resolving central or peripheral consolidation, especially with associated nodules, raises the possibility of BAC. The stretching, attenuation, sweeping and widening of branching air-filled bronchi within an area of consolidation on CT favor the diagnosis of BAC (2).

No PCR or other DNA assay.","MRSA was first identified in the 1960s, reflecting the response of S aureus to widespread exposure to penicillins. Indeed, MRSA now accounts for 20%-40% of all hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Until recently, most of the MRSA strains causing health care-ssociated pneumonia (HCAP), HAP, and VAP were labeled hospital-acquired MRSA (HAMRSA) and contained the staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec types I-III. Recently, however, a new variant of MRSA has emerged as a pulmonary pathogen. This new variant of S. aureus that causes pneumonia is community-acquired MRSA (CAMRSA), containing SCCmec type IV. CA-MRSA, although primarily a cause of skin and soft-tissue infection, has proved to be a formidable cause of pneumonia. 

Overall, MRSA is an important cause of pneumonia. A survey of 59 US hospitals, involving 4543 patients with culture-positive pneumonia, between January 2002 and January 2004 identified MRSA as a potential pathogen in 8.9% of CAP cases, 26.5% of HCAP cases, 22.9% of HAP cases, and 14.6% of VAP cases. 

Diagnosis is based on positive blood cultures accompany only 5%-15% of HAP cases and 24%-36% of VAP cases. Endotracheal microbiological sampling has shown only 40% agreement with lung biopsy, and only 15% of the samples met adequacy criteria for having originated from the lower respiratory tract. 

The differentiation HRMRSA from CAMRSA is frequently difficult on clinical settings.

The criteria for the diagnosis of postirradiation sarcoma was first proposed by Cahan et al. in 1948 and consisted of (1) history of radiation therapy, (2) sarcoma arising within the radiation field after the radiation has been given, (3) long latency period, and (4) histologic confirmation of the sarcoma.

"," Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is the most common variant of large cell carcinoma, accounting for approximately 3% of surgically resected lung cancers. It fits into the spectrum of neuroendocrine lung neoplasm and is a high-grade non-small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma that differs from atypical carcinoid and small cell carcinoma [1]. Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung is defined as a poorly differentiated and high-grade neuroendocrine tumor that morphologically and biologically may be placed between atypical carcinoid tumor and small cell carcinoma [2].

  Radiologic findings of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma usually appears as a well-defined and lobulated tumor with no air bronchograms or calcification. The inhomogeneous enhancement (caused by necrosis) seen in large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas with large diameters is not necessarily apparent in small-diameter (< 33 mm) large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, even if the tumor contains necrosis.  However, infrequently tumor margin may appear to be spiculated. Those spiculated margins appeared as fibrotic strands because of paracicatricial emphysema or linear opacities made more pronounced by preexisting emphysema. CT findings of large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas were similar to those of other expansively growing tumors, such as peripheral small cell carcinomas, poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas [3].
  Patients with large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas have a significantly worse survival after resection than patients with large cell carcinomas, even in stage I disease. Accurate differentiation of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma from large cell carcinoma is important because it identifies those patients at highest risk for the development of recurrent lung cancer.

Non-contrast CT scans demostrate patch areas of consolidation in the left upper lobe, of which attenuation is higher than vascular attenuation in the mediastinum. The attenuation of the liver is unusually high on non-contrast CT, raising the suspicion of iodine deposition in patients with history of amiodarone medication.
	Bronchioloaveolar lavage reveals non-specific findings with mainly macrophages with some lymphocytes and neutrophils, without malignant cells. Transbronchial lung biopsy at the left upper lobe reveals only foamy macrophage aggregates with fibrin. 
	In the patient's past medical history, he ingested amiodarone for arrhythmia for one years. Treatment was the cessation of amiodarone medication. In five days after discontinuation, patchy consolidations in the left upper lobe start to decrease in extent (arrow in figure 5). On two months follow up, the consolidation is markedly decreased in extent (arrow in figure 6), which confirms adiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity and its improvement on cessation of amiodarone.

","Amiodarone is one of the most frequently used medication for refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity was recognized in 1980, and remains a significant cause of drug-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD). Pulmonary toxicity occurs in approximately 5-10% of patients, usually within months of starting therapy. Clinically, amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity manifests with dyspnea, a dry cough, weight loss, malaise, moderate fever and, sometimes, mild pleuritic chest pain.
	NSIP is the most common manifestation of amiodarone-induced lung disease. Pleural inflammation is an accompanying feature and can manifest as pleural effusion. BOOP is less common and typically occurs in association with NSIP. A distinctive feature of amiodarone toxicity is the occurrence of focal, homogeneous pulmonary opacities. These opacities are typically peripheral in location and of high attenuation at CT due to incorporation of amiodarone into the type II pneumocytes. Amiodarone and its metabolite accumulate in many organs, achieving concentrations in lung tissue that are toxic to lung cells. Two iodines are present for each molecule of amiodarone or its metabolite. The combination of high-attenuation abnormalities within the lung, liver, or spleen are characteristic of amiodarone toxicity.

Paraquat (1,1’-dimethyl-4,4’-bipyridylium dichloride) is a widely used herbicide that has toxic effects on the lung, liver and kidneys. Death from paraquat poisoning was primarily caused by progressive pulmonary damage with respiratory failure (1). The toxic effects of paraquat are through to result from oxygen radicals that destroy the cell membrane (2). Organ damage by paraquat depends on the balance between oxygen radicals and tissue levels of oxygen and antioxidants. Organ-specific damage to the lung is caused by both lower concentration of the antioxidants and higher concentration of oxygen within the lung. Early pathologic finding in the lung include thickening of the alveolar walls by edema, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cells. Some of the alveoli fill with fluid and large amount of fibrin (3). Late pathologic findings include pulmonary fibrosis and microcysts (2).

During the first 7 days after ingestion, the preponderant radiologic abnormality was diffuse consolidation. Cystic (2-9mm) and linear opacities then appeared within the consolidated lung during the next 7 days, and this pattern was the preponderant finding after 2 weeks.

This insufficient production is caused by either bone marrow replacement disease (myelofibrosis or chronic myelogenous leukemia) or hemolytic anemia (thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, or hereditary spherocytosis). The liver, spleen, kidney, lymph nodes, and posterior mediastinum are the most common sites of EMH. 
Intrathoracic EMH may manifest as a paraosseous mass, interstitial pulmonary abnormality, pleural mass, or hemothorax, either alone or in combination. The paraspinal masses and rib expansion are the most common manifestation of intrathoracic EMH. The paraspinal masses have to be differentiated from lymphadenopathy and neurogenic tumors. Cases of EMH involving the pulmonary interstitium mimick an inflammatory or neoplastic diffuse interstitial process and have occasionally resulted in cardiopulmonary insufficiency. EMH usually regresses or disappears after treatment with blood transfusion and hydroxyurea, splenectomy in cases of spherocytosis, or radiation therapy. 
In conclusion, the combination of homogeneously enhancing bilateral paraspinal masses with hepatosplenomegaly and gallstones, which occur frequently in hereditary spherocytosis patient makes EMH the most likely diagnosis.

Over one-half of patients with SLE develop pulmonary disease, with pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, and lupus pneumonitis being the most common manifestations. The most common patterns of parenchymal involvement are cellular, fibrotic, or mixed nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP).

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is an increasingly recognized complication of SLE. Less than one-half of patients have pathologic abnormalities of pulmonary vessels. Vascular abnormalities typically afflict small vessels only and most commonly and most severely in the muscular arteries. Varying degrees of smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, intimal fibrosis, inflammatory cellular infiltration of pulmonary arterioles (vasculitis), destruction of the elastic laminae, and in situ thrombosis may be observed. In the early phase of the disease, chest radiographic findings may be normal.

","In the belief that collapsing the lung around the foci of tuberculous infection provided for anatomic healing of the lesions,  physicians in the first half of the 20th century performed artificial extrapleural pneumothorax.  If the patient tolerated artificial pneumothorax well, the surgeon injected or implanted plombe, a space-filling substance, during a second operation in order to compress the lung. Many substances were tried as substrate for plombe, and they included fat, gauze packing, oil, paraffin wax, bone, rubber bag, muscle, and synthetic materials, such as methylmacrylate spheres, fiberglass, polyethylene sheeting, and polystan sponge. There were complications resulting from collapse therapy including infection of the plombage space, blood vessel erosion, hemorrhage, and breach of the underlying parenchymal cavitation. It is said that paraffin wax, the material presumably used as plombe in this patient, were more prone to infection and extrusion, and thus was largely replaced by methylmacrylate, or lucite balls. With time, it became apparent that lucite also causes complications such as migration into adjacent structures and erosion of overlying ribs. Plombage thoracoplasty were also known to cause neoplastic complications to the chest wall, including epithelioid angiosarcoma, lung carcinoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Performing extrapleural plombage for collapse therapy eventually fell out of favor as an optimal treatment for tuberculosis, largely due to introduction of antimicrobial therapy.

He underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery biopsy at areas of ground glass opacities in right superior segment of RLL and posterior segment of RUL. One week later, he complained of more worsening dyspnea with progression of the lesion on serial follow up chest radiographs. Follow up chest radiograph (Figure 6, answer) and chest CT scan ( Figure 7-10, answer) showed more progression of the ground glass opacities and more fibrosis / parenchymal distorsion in both upper lobes than prior study. Ten days later after the biopsy, pathologic results showed fibroblast plug in the bronchiole with extension to the alveolar ducts (Figure 11). On the results of the clinical, radiologic and pathologic findings, we diagnosed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia in this case. After steroid therapy, his symptoms and chest radiographic findings have improved.

","Castleman disease is not a distinct disease entity, but rather it is a diverse group of rare lymphoproliferative disorders of differing histopathologic properties and biologic behavior. It is classified into two major subgroups: localized Castleman disease and disseminated Castleman disease. There are two major histologic variants: hyaline-vascular Castleman disease and plasma cell Castleman disease. Most patients with localized thoracic Castleman disease have hyaline-vascular Castleman disease. Localized hyaline-vascular Castleman disease affects individuals of all age groups, with a peak incidence in the fourth decade of life. Female patients are more commonly affected.
On CT images, it manifests as a homogenous or heterogeneous soft tissue mass with marked enhancement. McAdams et al. reported three morphologic patterns: (a) a solitary mass, (b) a dominant infiltrative mass with associated lymphadenopathy, (c) diffuse lymphadenopathy confined to a single mediastinal compartment. Identification of the solitary mass pattern suggests that complete surgical resection is likely.

Also irregular shaped abscess in the Lt perinephric space. The involvement of kidney is very rare.
","Human paragonimiasis is caused by the trematode Paragonimus westermani or other Paragonimus species through the ingestion of raw or partially cooked freshwater crabs or crayfish infected with the metacercaria. The main endemic areas are east Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America (primarily Peru), and Africa (primarily Nigeria). The lung is the target organ. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting parasite eggs in the sputum, pleural fluid, or feces; in addition, larvae can often be found at bronchial brushing. Intradermal and serologic tests are also available. The penetration of juvenile worms through the diaphragm into the pleural cavity can cause pleural effusion (37%) or pneumothorax (17%). Once the parasites get to the lung, patchy airspace consolidation can occur, the presence of an exudative or hemorrhagic pneumonia which can cavitate. Contrast  enhanced CT may show hypoattenuating fluid-filled cysts surrounded by hyperattenuating consolidation in the adjacent lung. Linear areas of increased opacity indicate peripheral atelectasis or worm migration. Worm cysts manifest as either solitary or multiple nodules or gas-filled cysts depending on their content and their communication with the airway.

","Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) is subtype of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and often grouped with usual interstitial pneumonia within the spectrum of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, recent studies revealed that DIP differs from usual interstitial pneumonia in its histologic appearance, radiologic findings, and, most importantly, its natural course. Approximately 90% of patients with DIP are cigarette smokers. Most cases of DIP are currently considered to represent a reaction to cigarette smoke. 
Chest radiographs are insensitive for detection of DIP and are reported to be normal in 3%?2% of biopsy-proved cases. The radiologic patterns are nonspecific and include patchy ground-glass opacities with a lower lung and peripheral predominance. The predominant abnormality at high-resolution CT in patients with DIP is ground-glass opacity, which may be peripheral, patchy, or diffuse in distribution. A peripheral subpleural and basal predominance of ground-glass opacity is most commonly seen. Honeycombing is uncommon. Coexistent emphysema may be present. At follow-up high-resolution CT of patients receiving treatment, the ground-glass opacity may show partial or complete resolution. Small cystic spaces may develop within the areas of ground-glass opacity, although progression to reticular abnormality and honeycombing is unusual.

Fever with chills, sweating, anemia, leucopenia, and splenomegaly are the mot common clinical findings. Typical clinical symptom are periodicity of the episodic fever (tertian or quartan), every 48 and 72 hours. Reported complication of malaria include pulmonary disease, CNS dysfunction, nephrotic syndome, coagulation abnormalities, bone marrow hyperplasia and spleenic rupture. Pulmonary complications with malaria range from simple respiratory symptoms to reported of pulmonary edema and ARDS.  A few reports of acute pulmonary edema associated with quinine therapy have been reported.Severe P falciparum infections is the type most commonly associated with ARDS, but cases caused by P vivax and P ovale habe also been reported.  Radiographic and CT findings are consistent with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, diffuse interstitial edema, and lobar consolidation may also be seen. Occasionally, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia has been reported. The current hypothesis of pulmonary edema and ARDS in malaria are  primary lung injury, changes result from vascular injury related to red blood cell sequestration and destruction, the release of parasite and erythrocyte material into the circulation, and the  host response to these event.

At that time, CT scan showed heterogenous enhancing soft tissue mass with encasement of both main bronchi and invasion of the left chest wall in the anterior mediastinum. When the excisional biopsy was done at the left chest wall, the pathologic diagnosis was fibrosing mediastinitis without any malignant cells. After low dose steroid therapy, the mediastinal mass size has been reduced.
       As time goes by, both neck swelling was newly developed. Five months later the CT scan shows heterogenous enhancing mass in both supraclavicular spaces as well as the anterior mediastinum. The neck mass displaced the carotid arteries and jugular veins. The excisional biopsy of the neck mass was performed for the definitive diagnosis.      
","ALCL is a distinct from of NHL that affects children and young adults predominantly. It was described first by Stein et al in 1985 when it was noted that a subset of malignant lymphomas expressed CD30 (Ki-1 antigen). Morphologically, these CD30+ lymphomas are composed of large cells with bizarre nuclei often co-expressing T-cell antigens. Prior to the recognition of CD30 staining, ALCL was classified in a variety of ways. ALCL is a T-cell NHL with a unique morphology, immunohistochemical staining pattern, cytogenetic abnormalities, and pathobiology. The unique genetic feature of ALCL is translocation involving the ALK gene located on chromosome 2p23. 
ALCL is relatively uncommon, accounting for 3% of all NHLs. Systemic ALCL is predominantly a disease of childhood and adolescence, and represents 10%-15% of all childhood NHLs and 30%-40% of large cell lympomas in the pediatric population. ALCL is most common in the first three decades of life, with a marked male predominance, especially in younger patients. 
Systemic ALCL presents with advanced stage (stages III-IV) disease in 65%-75% of patients. Nodal involvement is observed in 90% of systemic ALCL patients, with 40% having exclusive nodal involvement. ALCL can present with a locally invasive mediastinal mass, although less commonly than in HL. Adverse clinical prognostic factors include mediastinal involvement, visceral involvement, elevated LDH levels, and high-intermediate/high IPI scores. Relapse occur in 20%-40% of patients and can be treated effectively with salvage chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.

Note.

At first, we couldn’t extract entire mediastinal mass, we could provisionally conclude that the diagnosis of his mediastinal mass was fibrosing mediastinitis based on  the excisional biopsy result of the anterior chest wall mass and the reduction of the mass with low dose steroid therapy. Therefore, initially we thought that this case is valuable for report because fibrosing mediastinitis should be added for the differential diagnosis of the anterior mediastinal mass in adolescent. During follow-up, the neck mass was newly developed, the biopsy result of the neck mass was Hodgkins lymphoma nodular sclerosing type. However, though the final diagnosis was changed to lymphoma, we could get the value from this case as follow; when the pathologic finding of the anterior mediastinal mass by partially resected or percutaneous needle biopsy is negative for malignancy, we must suggest that the lesion may be malignancy through the imaging findings.

CT scan demonstrates multiple lymph node enlargements with central low attenuation and peripheral well enhancement in paratracheal, subcarinal, hilar space. Well defined nodules and small area of consolidation are visible in RLL, LUL and LLL.
","Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is clinically characterized by a high fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, a skin rash, and hepatosplenomegaly. This is a relatively rare disorder but one that is clinically distinctive. It accounts for less than 1% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas in Asia and Europe. Although this disorder has been regarded as an abnormal immune reaction (angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia or immunoblastic lymphadenopathy), it is now accepted as a subtype of PTCL. Because patients most commonly present with disseminated conditions, the imaging features are not distinguished from those in other lymphoma.
Primary pulmonary lymphoma cannot be distinguished from secondary pulmonary lymphoma solely on the basis of pathologic examination of pulmonary tissue only, because a variety of gross patterns of disease (solitary or multiple nodules, solitary infiltrate, or multiple infiltrates with or without hilar or mediastinal adenopathy) may be seen in either setting.
On chest radiographs, recurrent or secondary pulmonary lymphoma may present with various patterns: bronchovascuhar or lymphangitic with thickening of bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septae (41%), discrete pulmonary nodular (39%), pneumonic or alveolar with areas of consolidation (14%), and miliary or hematogenous with disseminated micronodules (6%). Lymphomatous infiltration of the alveoli can result in granuhomatous consolidation that may mimic the appearance of pneumonia or miliaiy tuberculosis. Lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions are also commonly present. Prevascular or pretracheal node involvement is seen most often. Other sites of lymph node involvement include the subcarinal, hilar,paraaortic, paravertebral, retrocrural nodes. Enlarged lymph nodes or mediastinal masses may appear low in attenuation due to necrosis.Other manifestations include cavitated masses and endobronchial masses.
Diagnosis is difficult because infection, granulomatous disease, primary or secondary carcinomas, or drug reactions may cause similar abnormal radiologic findings. Careful correlation of clinical, microbiologic, and histologic findings is necessary.

Stomach gas is seen in the right side suggesting situs inversus. Chest CT confirms cystic bronchiectasis and situs inversus. PNS view reveals sinusitis showing haziness in both maxillary sinuses.
","Kartagener's Syndrome is a chronic lung disease that occurs when cilia are unable to move. Kartagener's Syndrome is a rare genetic birth defect. Individuals with Kartagener's Syndrome have abnormal or absent ciliary motion. Kartagener's Syndrome is also called Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, and Immotile Cilia Syndrome, Afzelius’ syndrome, Kartagener’s triad, Zivert's syndrome, and Zivert-Kartagener triad. Cilia are tiny hair-like structures that are present on the surfaces of many different types of cells. One of the functions of cilia is to move mucus out of the respiratory passages. During infections more mucus is produced and because the abnormal cilia can't move or move ineffectively, mucus becomes stuck and blocks the respiratory tract, causing various complications.

Some common symptoms of Kartagener's syndrome are chronic rhinitis, recurrent or chronic sinusitis, recurrent or chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, olfactory impairment, and infertility.
Treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms and slowing disease progression. Complications of Kartagener's Syndrome include 
bronchiectasis, difficulty breasthing, and chronic wheezing and coughing. Bronchiectasis occurs when the bronchial tubes are blocked and chronically infected, causing the tubes to weaken and stretch out. The widened tubes allow more mucus and bacteria to accumulate, leading to infection and possibly pneumonia.

","Hantaviruses are lipid-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. Several antigenically different viruses from around the world (Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala, Dobrava, Prospect Hill, and Sin Nombre) have been found to cause a typical symptom complex called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Infected patients experience clinically characteristic courses of fever, hypotension, and renal failure. The most recently identified sixth organism (Sin Nombre virus) is known to more frequently cause severe and fulminant pulmonary disease than other organisms.  
The natural reservoir of all Hantaviruses is wild rodents and deer mice, the latter being the most important animal harboring the Sin Nombre variant in the United States. The organism is believed to be transmitted to humans by inhalation of dried rodent excreta associated with outdoor activities in rural areas, such as cleaning barns, plowing with hand tools, and harvesting rice.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome characteristically presents as respiratory distress from noncardiogenic edema. After an incubation period of 9-35 days, the syndrome begins to progress through its three stages. The initial stage is the prodromal phase, which is followed by the cardiopulmonary and convalescent phases. Histologically, interstitial and air-space edema, mild to moderate interstitial infiltrates of lymphocytes, epithelial necrosis, vascular thrombosis,
and hyaline membranes are seen (24). The lung disease in the Hantavirus syndrome has some distinct pathologic differences from diffuse alveolar damage due to other causes. They are extensive cellular debris, destruction of type I cells, prominence of type II cells, neutrophil infiltrates, and fibrosing alveolitis.
Radiographically, Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome presents as interstitial edema with or without rapid progression to air-space disease. The air-space disease shows a central or bibasilar distribution. Also, pleural effusion is a common finding. The radiographic findings in Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are consistent with a pulmonary capillary leak. However, pulmonary manifestations may occasionally be secondary to renal failure. In these cases, pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly with or without pleuropericardial effusion are the predominant findings in the oliguric phase of renal failure. However, in infection of the Sin Nombre organism, more severe findings with diffuse alveolar damage are usually seen. Recently, Boroja et al identified two broad categories of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome clinically and radiographically: a rapidly progressive, fulminant, and often fatal clinical form with radiographic features of rapidly progressive alveolar pulmonary edema, air-space consolidation, and pleural effusions; and a limited, less severe clinical form usually associated with mild interstitial edema and minimal air-space disease. All patients with the limited form of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome survived the illness, whereas 46% of those with the fulminant form died.

CT images (lung window settings) show dilatation of peripheral pulmonary vessels. Liver shows cirrhotic change and there are splenic varices.
","Hepatopulmonary syndrome is characterized by a triad of hypoxemia, hepatic dysfunction, and intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. Although the pathogenesis of vascular dilatation is unknown, some investigators have suggested that failure of the damaged liver to clear circulating vasodilators and inhibition of a circulating vasoconstrictive substance by the damaged liver. 
 Arterial hypoxemia in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome is thought to occur because of ventilation-perfusion mismatch, limitations in oxygen diffusion due to vascular dilatation, and in some patients, intrapulmonary shunt through dilated vascular malformations. 
On chest radiographs, intrapulmonary vascular dilation may manifest as small nodular or reticulonodular opacities, predominantly in the bases. The CT feature of hepatopulmonary syndrome is dilation of peripheral lung vessels with many extending to the pleura.
Lung perfusion imaging with 99mTc macroaggregated albumin can be used both in the detection of a right-to-left shunt and in the quantification of the degree of the shunt. In patients with normal pulmonary vasculature, nearly all the radioactive particles뾵hich typically range in size from 20 to 50 ?뾩odge in the pulmonary vascular bed, since pulmonary capillaries are only 8?5 ? in diameter. The presence of intrapulmonary vascular dilatations in patients with HPS allows passage of the radiolabeled macroaggregated albumin into the systemic circulation and results in the characteristic appearance of extrapulmonary uptake. Several studies that have evaluated prognostic factors in patients with HPS have shown that mortality is associated with higher shunt fractions, as measured with 99mTc macroaggregated albumin perfusion imaging.

The diagnosis is based on clinical findings of acute respiratory failure and presence of markedly elevated numbers of eosinophils in BAL fluid. The majority of cases are idiopathic. Occasionally, it may result from drug reaction (sertraline, progesterone) or inhalation exposure to smoke, particularly cigarette smoke. Tobacco smoke has been shown to be a trigger for acute eosinophilic pneumonia, especially in new-onset smokers. Patients respond rapidly to treatment with corticosteroid.

Typical radiographic finding is diffuse bilateral reticular opacities with or without patchy consolidation and pleural effusion. On chest CT, it shows findings of bilateral patchy area of ground glass opacity and consolidation accompanied with poorly defined nodules and smooth interlobular septal thickening. Pleural effusion is commonly combined.

The radiologic differential diagnosis for AEP includes hydrostatic pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome or acute interstitial pneumonia, and atypical bacterial or viral pneumonia. However, developing a clinicoradiologic differential diagnosis for AEP is often difficult because initial peripheral blood eosinophil counts are usually normal.

","Polymyositis is an autoimmune inflammatory myopathy characterized by symmetric weakness of the limb girdle and anterior neck muscles. Dermatomyositis is similar to polymyositis except for the presence of a characteristic skin rash. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis have an incidence of approximately 5-10 cases per million per year and occur twice as often in women as in men, with a bimodal peak age of occurrence during childhood and middle adulthood [1,2,3]. The thorax is commonly affected, generally in one or more of three forms: (a) hypoventilation and respiratory failure as a result of involvement of the respiratory muscles; (b) interstitial pneumonitis, usually with a histologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia ; and (c) aspiration pneumonia secondary to pharyngeal muscle weakness (probably the most common pulmonary complication) [1, 4].
Interstitial lung disease associated with polymyositis or dermatomyositis has a wide spectrum of histopathologic features. Three major groups can be identified on the basis of histologic patterns: BOOP, usual or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage. Histologic appearance is useful for determining the prognosis. 
Patients with diffuse alveolar damage r usual interstitial pneumonia have a poor prognosis, with only a 33% survival rate at 5 years; however, patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia have a good prognosis. Patients with BOOP have an excellent prognosis.
The frequency of radiographic parenchymal abnormalities is low (about 5%). The most common is a symmetric, predominantly basal reticular pattern that may become diffuse over time and progress to honeycombing [1,3]. Bilateral areas of consolidation develop in some patients over a 2- to 3-week period. This abnormality usually corresponds histologically to diffuse alveolar damage or BOOP. Initial high-resolution CT findings of pulmonary involvement in patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis are prominent interlobular septa, ground-glass attenuation, patchy consolidation, parenchymal bands, irregular  eribronchovascular thickening, and subpleural lines. Honeycombing may be seen in up to 16% of patients who have abnormal chest radiographic findings or pulmonary function.[1,5]

The most common radiographic manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis consist of single or multiple pulmonary nodules. Cavitation occurs in 10-15% of cases. Hilar and mediastinal adenopathy may accompany any of these patterns, as may pleural effusion. Segmental or lobar consolidation and miliary pattern are seen less commonly. Cryptococcal pneumonia in AIDS patients shows somewhat different features from those described in non immunocompromised patients in that nodular masses are uncommon and lymphadenopathy is a frequent findings.

Characteristic CT features of abdominal gossypibomas include a spongiform appearance with gas bubbles ; low-density mass with a thin enhancing capsule; and calcifications deposited along the network architecture of a surgical sponge. On the other hand, a sponge left within the pleural space shows no gas lucencies due to resorption of the air by the pleura.

In the lung, the term traditionally refers to a well-defined tumor consisting predominantly of cartilage and adipose tissue. It can occur within the lung parenchyma or in an endobronchial location.
Radiologically, pulmonary hamartomas typically are well-defined, solitary nodules without lobar predilection. The majority are smaller than 4cm in diameter, although some occasionally grow to a very large size. Although some studies have reported an incidence of calcification as high as 25 to 30 percent, others have identified it far less often. When calcification is present, however, the roentgenographic pattern most often resembles popcorn, a finding that is almost diagnostic. The presence of fat and calcium make the CT diagnosis exquisitely accurate.

Brief review
Neurogenic tumors of thorax may arise from the paraspinal ganglion of the symphathetic chain or from the intercostals nerves of the thoracic cage. Gnagiloneuroma is one of neurogenic tumor, composed entirely of ganglion cell and Schwannian stroma. Ganglioneuroma often manifests as an symptomatic mass and so, it is discovered on a routine radiographic study as this case. Plain radiograph typically shows a posterior mediastinal mass. On US, it is homogenous, hypoechoic mass with well defined borders. CT scan reveals low attenuation and homogenous mass on unenhanced CT and slight to moderate enhancement. At MR imaging, ganglioneuroma has low signal intensity on T1WI and high on T2WI. Enhancement of ganglioneuroma varies from mild to marked.

","Most patients with multiple myeloma present with signs or symptoms related to the infiltration of plasma cells into the bone or other organs or to kidney damage from excess light chains. A normocytic, normochromic anemia is present in 73 % at diagnosis. Bone pain, particularly in the back or chest, and less often in the extremities, is present at the time of diagnosis in approximately 60 % of patients. The serum creatinine concentration is increased in almost one-half of patients at diagnosis in approximately 20 %. It is important to evaluate patients suspected of having MM in a timely fashion since a major delay in diagnosis has been associated with a negative impact on the disease course.

Multiple osteolytic lesions with discrete margins are typically detected radiologically in the vertebral column, ribs, or clavicles. Sclerosis generally develops in the osteolytic lesions after pathologic fracture, irradiation, or chemotherapy but occasionally can be seen also in untreated lesions. Pleural effusion and diffuse pulmonary involvement due to plasma cell infiltration are rare and usually occur in advanced disease.

The patients initially underwent chest PA and CT for the evaluation of chest pain. After 6 months later, multiple osteolytic lesions were found in the rib, spine and skull. CT guided biopsy for the pleural based lesion revealed that the lesion is multiple myeloma.

The crazing paving appearance showing patch areas of ground glass opacity with inter- and intra-septal thickening and focal consolidations is seen in RML on HRCT scans. 
Poorly defined small centrilobular nodules are also noted in RML. On PET-CT, focal area of increased FDG uptake is seen in the right lower lung zone. On the follow-up chest radiograph after 40 days, there is no definite interval change of focal increase opacity in RML. She had a history of repeated ingestion of shark liver oil (squalene). 
","Exogenous lipoid pneumonia is a rare disorder caused by the aspiration or inhalation of mineral, vegetable. or animal oils present in food, radiographic contrast media, or oil-based medications into the lung. Squalene, produced from shark liver oil, is used in some Asian countries as a folk remedy.
Mineral oils, and similar substances, do not irritate the pharyngeal mucosa; therefore, they do not stimulate the gag reflex.
Patients particularly at risk for exogenous lipoid pneumonia include those with risk factors for aspiration such as swallowing dysfunction, episodes of loss of consciousness, and extremes of age.
On chest radiographs, lipoid pneumonia has been shown to have many different manifestations. Most series do not differentiate between acute and chronic presentations. The previous study described lipoid pneumonia due to squalene ingestion as having areas of ground glass opacity, consolidation, and poorly defined small nodules.
On CT, exogenous lipoid pneumonia may be diagnosed when areas of fat attenuation are present within a pulmonary opacity. However, in some cases of lipoid pneumonia, fat attenuation is not evident on CT because the fat attenuation values are averaged with surrounding inflammatory exudates. Other CT findings of lipoid pneumonia include ground glass opacities, thickened intralobular septae, and small cystic areas. Thin section CT findings in relatively asymptomatic patients with exogenous lipoid pneumonia include diffuse ground glass opacities, multifocal airspace consolidation, and interstitial opacities. 
Right middle lobe and both lower lobes are commonly involved. Complete recovery or partial clearance of these lesions can be seen after cessation of squalene ingestion.
On PET-CT, similar to inflammatory and infectious lung diseases, lipoid pneumonia may be a false-positive case of F-18 FDG uptake.

Lung, right middle lobe, needle biopsy(H&E X 400): Foamy macrophages and chronic inflammatory cells(arrows) are noted.

Contrast-enhanced CT images show enhancement in the thickened esophageal wall. Left pleural effusion is associated. 
 Fish bone impaction on the esophageal wall causing mucosal perforation with esophagitis was revealed and removal of the bone with clipping of the perforation site was done through endoscopy. 
","Most ingested objects pass spontaneously, without intervention. However, the thin esophageal wall, the lack of a supporting adventitia, and the relatively poor blood supply leave the esophagus vulnerable to perforation and pressure necrosis from foreign bodies that become lodged in it. Between 10% and 20% of ingested foreign bodies, including those retained within the esophagus, therefore require endoscopic
removal, and surgery is needed in about 1% of cases . 
The clinical manifestations of esophageal foreign body impaction are variable: Symptoms may include dysphagia, odynophagia, foreign body sensation, and food refusal. Regurgitation and an inability to swallow saliva are suggestive of esophageal obstruction. When a history of foreign body ingestion is elicited, a radiographic
evaluation is performed, generally with conventional radiography of the neck, chest, and
abdomen . Barium studies are discouraged because they may hinder subsequent attempts at endoscopic examination and retrieval. 
CT may be useful in select cases when a more definitive diagnosis or localization is desired before endoscopic intervention, or when perforation or another complication is suspected. In patients who do not provide a history of foreign body ingestion and who report nonspecific symptoms such as chest pain, CT often is used to distinguish
between or exclude potential causes during the initial evaluation.
The CT appearance of foreign body impaction is variable, depending on the item ingested, the site of impaction, and the presence of an underlying pathologic esophageal process or associated complication.

Approximately 90 percent of esophageal leiomyomas occur in patients between 20 and 60 years old and approximately 60% of leiomyomas occur in the lower third of the esophagus. Esophageal leiomyomas grow slowly and usually produce intermittent, insidiously progressive symptoms. Occasionally, they encircle the esophagus in a serpentine or U-shaped fashion and cause obstructive symptoms. It manifests as a smoothly marginated, round or lobulated mass with homogenous attenuation projecting to one or both sides of the mediastinum along the course of the esophagus. According to the report, tumor attenuation was homogeneously low or iso and, characteristically, the same even when contrast medium was administered.

","Aspergillus infection may manifest in clinically and radiologically distinct patterns: aspergilloma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, semi-invasive aspergillosis, airway invasive aspergillosis, and angioinvasive aspergillosis. 60% of fungal pneumonias in immunocompromised patients are caused by Aspergillus. Aspergillus infection may also occur in normal host following massive inhalation, known as primary aspergillosis.
Angioinvasive aspergiollosis is caused by hyphal invasion of blood vessels resulting in infarction and necrosis. Clinically, it is characterized by a hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia with fever, cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. CT typically shows nodules or masses may be surrounded by a halo of ground glass attenuation (CT halo sign). The halo sign is caused by hemorrhage surrounding the nodule or mass of necrotic fungal infected lung tissue. After 2~3 weeks, crescentic and eventual circumferential cavitation may be seen (air crescent sign). It may evolve to aspergilloma.
Airway-invasive aspergillosis is less common than angioinvasive aspergillosis. It is characterized by the presence of Aspergillus deep to the airway basement membrane. It causes a spectrum of diseases, including acute tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, and bronchopneumonia. Centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud opacities, and peribronchial consolidations can be seen at HRCT. Invasive tracheobronchial aspergillosis is associated with ulcerations of trachea and central bronchi, and can cause atelectasis and consolidation.

PET-CT scans show mild heterogenous increased FDG uptake (SUV=3.7) in pulmonary mass in right lung.","Lebow and Hybbell first described sclerosing hemangioma in 1956. It is a rare benign tumor, characterized microscopically by four major histologic components: solid, papillary, sclerotic, and hemngiomatous in varying proportions. There have been many investigations of the histogenesis of the tumor, but it is still uncertain whether its origin is endothelial or epithelial. However, recent immunohistochemical and ultrastructural data support the concept that sclerosing hemangioma is an epithelial neoplasm derived from type II pneumocytes and bronchiolar epithelial cells. Four pathologic patterns are recognized: solid, hemorrhagic, papillary, and sclerotic. There is a female-to-male predominance of approximately 4 to 5:1, a gender difference that may be related to the presence of estrogen receptors in some tumors. Most lesions are discovered in patients between 30 and 50 years of age. Most cases were asymptomatic, but some presented with hemoptysis, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and pleurisy. The lesions range from 0.8 to 8.2 cm in diameter, but most are less than 3.5 cm in diameter. They are usually well-defined, circumscribed, hemorrhagic nodules.  The tumor is often subpleural, and a thin fibrous pseudocapsule separates it from the adjacent compressed lung parenchyma. On CT, sclerosing hemangioma appeared as well defined juxtapleural masses in all cases. The tumors enhanced by visual criteria in all but one patient with the smallest mass. The CT density of the enhancing mass ranged from 96 to 157 HU. Some patients had calcifications and a few had well defined areas of low attenuation, corresponding with angiomatous, solid and sclerotic, and cystic areas, retrospectively. MRI findings were also reported: They had mixed areas of high and low signal intensity on both T1- and T2- weighted images and were totally enhanced on postcontrast enhanced T1-weighted images. The T1 high signal intensity areas corresponded to those including abundant clear cells, and the T2-weighted low signal intensity areas corresponded to the fibrotic or hemorrhagic areas in the tumors.
The experience using FDG-PET scan in sclerosing hemangioma is limited. There are only two published reports of FDG-PET scan findings in sclerosing hemangioma. In the patient reported by Hara et al., only slightly elevated uptake with an SUV of 1.8 was noted.8 In the patient reported by de Koning et al., the uptake was only slightly greater than background (SUV of 1.6).9 In contrast, two patients reported by HSU et al., the masses demonstrated SUV of 2.72 and 3.93, respectively, which were well above the cut-off value (SUV of 2.5) suggestive of malignancy. The high FDG uptake may be attributed to the larger tumour size and potentially low-grade malignant nature of sclerosing hemangioma, a conclusion also supported by the elevated level of tumor marker, CA-153, in the second patient.

","Congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM) historically referred to as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAM) is a rare anomaly of the lung. These lesions form masses of maldeveloped lung tissue and are identified most commonly in stillborn infants or newborns with respiratory distress. In adult, CCAM may be an incidental finding or may be accompanied by symptoms related to recurrent respiratory infections. Less common complications include pneumothorax and occasionally, the development of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma. In older children and adults, CCAMs usually appear radiologically as a unilocular or multiloculated cyst or as a complex soft tissue and cystic mass. The CT manifestation in adults typically consist of a unilocular or multiloculated cyst or a complex soft tissue and cystic mass. CCAM have been classified into 5 subtypes (types 0 to 4) by Stocker. This classification was based on the histopathologic findings in the area of the tracheobronchial tree involved by the malformation. Of these, Types I-III have been well described in the imaging literature. Type I CCAM contains one or more cysts larger than 2 cm in diameter, usually surrounded by smaller cysts. In Type II lesions, the cysts are less than 2 cm in diameter. Type III CCAM is usually shows as a bulky, solid mass. This classification system also has prognostic significance. Type I CCAM is associated with the best overall prognosis and may go undetected clinically until later in life. Type II CCAM has an increased incidence of severe cardiac or renal anomalies. Type III CCAM is often a large mass associated with stillbirth or death in the neonatal period. Because the majority of cases are associated with recurrent infection and risk for development of carcinoma, CCAMs are usually removed surgically. Lobectomy is generally required.

",Pulmonary leptospirosis,"A 57-year-old male complained of fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum for one day.  On a chest radiograph, there were areas of increased opacity in both upper lung zones. On the same day, he had an episode of hemoptysis (approximately 300 cc) and required intubation for hypoxemia. His chest radiograph obtained at 15 hours later demonstrated extensive, ill-defined consolidation involving both lungs. The patient was diagnosed as having leptospirosis by positive serologic test.
A CT image (Figure 1) shows areas of consolidation mixed with ground-glass opacities in both upper lobes. These findings may be attributed to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage related to leptospirosis. On a bronchoscopy, large amount of fresh blood appeared without demonstrable endobronchial lesion (Figure 2).","Leptospirosis, a zoonosis caused by spirochetes from the species Leptospira interrogans, occurs worldwide, but is more common in tropical regions. Humans become infected from direct contact with the urine of infected animals or from exposure to soil, water, or other matter contaminated with it. The spirochetes enter the host through abraded skin or intact mucous membranes and travel to the liver where they reproduce. After an incubation period of 2 to 30 days, leptospiremia occurs, spreading organisms to all parts of the body.
Pulmonary symptoms occur in both the non-icteric and icteric forms, including chest pain secondary to myositis or with a pleuritic character. Many case reports, clinical series, and descriptions of outbreak document the frequent occurrence of hemoptysis and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. The primary mechanism of pulmonary hemorrhage in leptospirosis is vasculitis.
Radiographic findings commonly accompany pulmonary symptoms but may occur without them. In on series, 82% of patients with hemoptysis had abnormal chest radiography. Abnormal findings appear as early as 24h after symptoms begin, although more commonly 3 to 9 days later. Three radiographic patterns occur: (1) Small “snowflake-like” nodular densities corresponding to areas of alveolar hemorrhage, (2) large confluent consolidations, and (3) a diffuse, ill-defined ground-glass pattern that may represent resolving hemorrhage. Serial radiographs may show progression from a nodular pattern to confluent consolidation.

Chops of raw cow liver are usually served along with usual cooked or barbecued meat. Some people believe that raw liver and meat are good for health, particularly for eyesight.
Like animals, human infections may take place in 2 ways: 1) ingestion of embryonated eggs, and 2) transfer (ingestion) of encapsulated larvae of T. canis in the tissues of a paratenic host. In certain ethnic groups, some adults tend to eat uncooked animal tissues which contain encapsulated infective larvae. After swallowing, the encapsulated larvae are liberated after hatching in the small intestine, penetrate the intestinal wall, get into the portal vein, and then reach the liver and lungs. They again become encapsulated and remain alive for a certain period. Uncooked livers of cow, pig, lamb, and chicken have been reported as sources of human infections.
High parasitic loads or repeated infection can lead to visceral larva migrans (VLM).VLM is primarily diagnosed in young children, because they are more prone to exposure and ingestion of infective eggs.[","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-749-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-749-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-749-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-749-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-749-5.jpg']",101,"['correct:29/101', 'diff:18/101']"

Diagnostic criteria include acute febrile illness of less than 5 days of duration; hypoxemia; diffuse alveolar or mixed alveolar-interstitial opacities on chest radiographs; BAL fluid consisting of more than 25% eosinophils; absence of parasitic, fungal, or other infection; prompt and complete response to corticosteroids; and no relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroids. Peripheral blood eosinophils percentages are usually normal, although they become elevated during the subsequent clinical course. Unlike with blood eosinophils, a very high percentage of BAL eosinophils is characteristic of AEP. Patients respond rapidly to high doses of corticosteroids, usually within 24 hrs.
Characteristic CT findings in AEP patients consisted mainly of bilateral areas of ground-glass attenuation, interlobular septal thickening, thickening of bronchovascular bundles, and the presence of a pleural effusion without cardiomegaly.

","Pulmonary nodules are uncommon manifestations of rheumatoid disease and identified in less than 1% of chest radiographs of patients with RA. These nodules occur most often in seropositive men who smoke and have subcutaneous nodules.
 They are frequently located in the periphery of the right middle or both upper lobes, range from several millimeters to several centimeters in diameter, and may be single or multiple.
 Central cavitation occurs in about half of the nodules and calcification is rare. These nodules are usually asymptomatic. The clinical course of pulmonary rheumatoid nodules varies substantially. The nodules may precede clinical evidence of RA or may be seen concurrently, may increase in size, resolve spontaneously, or appear at new sites as older nodules are resolving. Caplan뭩 syndrome represents an association of pulmonary nodules and pneumoconiosis in patients with RA.
 Histologically, rheumatoid pulmonary nodules are characterized by a central zone of fibrinoid necrosis, surrounded by a layer of palisading mononuclear cells within an outer zone of vascular granulation tissue, lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, and fibroblasts. Although the pathogenesis of the nodules is unknown, vasculitis caused by immune complex deposition has been implicated

There are divided into Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Further subdivisions depend on the histologic type. Intrathoracic involvement is more common in HL than NHL. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the most common of the NHL. It can arise in lymph nodes or outside of the lymphatic system, in the GI tract, testes, thyroid, skin, breast, bone or brain. 
 Lymphoma may involve any nodal chain in the body, and enlarged nodes are most common manisfestation on CT scans. Regardless of the area of involvement, nodal involvement of lymphoma has attenuation similar to muscle and homogeneous attenuation on CT scan.
 Involvement of the lung parenchyma at the time of initial diagnosis is more common in HL than NHL. The patterns of lymphomatous involvement of the lung parenchyma are variable. In a review of the CT findings in 31 patients with pulmonary parenchymal lymphoma, the most common CT findings were nodules or mass-like consolidation larger than 1 cm (68% of patients) and small nodules less than 1cm (61%). Other manifestations include GGO, thickening of the interlobular septa, and occasionally endobronchial lesions. One pattern consists of single or multiple nodules similar to those seen in metastatic disease. The other patterns consist of mediastinal of hilar adenopathy with direct extension along lymphatic vessel into the lung parenchyma.
 Extranodal lymphoma in GI tract occurs in 10-30% of all patients with NHL. In contrast to adenocarcinoma arising from GI tract, lymphoma is more likely involve multiple and longer segments of gut and is less likely to cause bowel obstruction.

Lemierre's syndrome develops most often after a sore throat caused by some bacterium of the Streptococcus genus, has created a peritonsillar abscess, a crater filled with pus and bacteria near the tonsils. Deep in the abscess, anaerobic bacteria (microbes that do not require oxygen) like Fusobacterium necrophorum can flourish. The bacteria penetrate from the abscess into the neighboring jugular vein in the neck and there they cause an infected clot (thrombosis) to form, from which bacteria are seeded throughout the body by the bloodstream (bacteremia). Pieces of the infected clot break off and travel to the lungs as emboli blocking branches of the pulmonary artery bringing the heart's blood to the lungs. This causes shortness of breath, chest pain and severe pneumonia. Fusobacteria are normal inhabitants of the oropharyngeal flora. This is a very rare disease with only approximately 159 cases in the last 100 years.[2]

Sepsis following from a throat infection was described by Scottmuller in 1918. However it was Andre Lemierre, in 1936, who published a series of 20 cases where throat infections were followed by identified anaerobic septicemia, of whom 18 patients died.[3]

When they coexist, either or both may be independently affected by neoplastic, infectious, or infiltrative processes. Follicular adenoma, papillary carcinoma, follicular carcinoma, and primary ectopic thyroid B cell lymphoma have been reported previously (4, 5). CT and radionuclide imaging can suggest or make the diagnosis in most cases. The differential diagnosis includes other mediastinal tumors that show high attenuation on unenhanced CT.

","Silicosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis result from inhalation of different inorganic dusts and have different histology. However,their radiological and HRCT appearances are quite similar.
There are two manifestations of silicosis and CWP - simple or uncomplicated and complicated type. The unique manifestation of acute exposure to large amounts of silica is termed silicoproteinosis.
The presence of large opacities (>1cm),also known as conglomerate mass or progressive massive fibrosis, indicates presence of complicated silicosis or CWP. In patients with silicosis, these masses represent a conglomeration of silicotic nodules associated with dense fibrous tissue; in CWP, they consist of amorphous black mass surrounded  by some fibrous tissue. The masses can undergo necrosis and cavitation.
On plain radiograph these masses are first seen in midportion or periphery of upper lung zones and migrate towards hila with time leaving emphysematous changes between them and pleural surface. On CT, conglomerate masses are usually seen to be associated with a background of small nodules. They are usually oval and often have irregular borders. Apical scarring and adjacent bulla may be seen. Calcification, cavitation or necrosis can be seen in the conglomerate masses.
Complicated form of silicosis has a poor prognosis than simple silicosis, but this is not necessarily the case with CWP.

She is an ordinary housewife and her favorite pastime was a ceramic sculpture. Her symptoms and radiologic findings have gradually improved after initiation of corticosteroid therapy and after cessation of a ceramic sculpture.
","Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a diffuse granulomatous interstitial lung disease caused by inhalation of various antigenic organic particles. A high index of suspicion and meticulous acquisition of an environmental and occupational history are essential in making the diagnosis. 
Lung biopsy is often necessary for confident diagnosis, and most cases of HP, whether acute or insidious, include the following four histologic features in variable amounts and combinations: cellular bronchiolitis, diffuse chronic interstitial inflammatory infiltrates (primarily consisting of lymphocytes and plasma cells), and poorly circumscribed interstitial nonnecrotizing (noncaseating) granulomas.

HP traditionally has been classified as manifesting in three phases: acute, subacute, and chronic. 
Although this classification is helpful, patients often present with both subacute and chronic findings. Subacute HP is caused by intermittent or continuous exposure to low doses of antigen.
The characteristic high-resolution CT manifestations of subacute HP consist of patchy or diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities, poorly defined small centrilobular nodules, and lobular areas of decreased attenuation and vascularity on inspiratory images and of air trapping on expiratory
images. The ground-glass opacities primarily reflect the presence of diffuse lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis; minor degrees of organizing pneumonia, when present, also can contribute to this appearance. The poorly defined centrilobular nodules may be caused by cellular bronchiolitis, the predominantly peribronchiolar distribution of interstitial pneumonitis, or focal areas of organizing pneumonia. The lobular areas of decreased attenuation and air trapping are presumably caused by small-airway obstruction by cellular bronchiolitis or, less commonly, by constrictive bronchiolitis. In the appropriate clinical setting these findings strongly suggest the diagnosis.

","Benign metastasizing leiomyoma is a rare condition characterized by numerous well-differentiated leiomyomas at sites distant from the uterus.
Metastases most often affect the lungs, whereas the heart, brain, lymph nodes,
bone, and skin are more rarely affected. The condition usually manifests as multiple incidentally detected pulmonary nodules in middle-aged women. A history of hysterectomy for uterine leiomyoma may be indicative, with the mean reported interval between hysterectomy and the appearance of pulmonary nodules ranging from 3 months to 20 years.
Symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough have been described.
Although the clinical course is usually indolent, a more rapid progression to severe respiratory symptoms also has been reported.
It is now largely accepted that the lesions arise as hematogenous metastases from benign tumors.
The radiologic imaging appearance of pulmonary nodules in benign metastasizing leiomyomas varies from solitary subcentimeter lesions to multiple lesions mimicking pulmonary metastases from malignant tumors. Cavitation of lesions occasionally take place and rarely may be accompanied by pneumothorax. Calcification is rare. Occasional cases with a military pattern and a pattern simulating interstitial lung disease have been documented. Both CT and MR imaging may be used to depict the pulmonary nodules in benign metastasizing leiomyoma, which have a nonspecific appearance and usually enhance homogeneously. The inclusion of particular entities in the differential diagnosis depends on the size of the nodules, but the most commonly included are metastases from malignant tumors.
The absent FDG uptake of the pulmonary lesions on PET imaging can help to rule out metastasis from extrathoracic tumors or uterine sarcoma. However, nodular lung lesions without FDG uptake and malignant behavior have been described, so we should keep in mind that the differential diagnosis also includes well-differentiated neoplasms, metastasis of tumors with a mucinous component (breast, renal, and gastrointestinal), neuroendocrine tumors, multifocal bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, and carcinoid tumors.

Intravascular leiomyomatosis (IVL) is defined by a proliferation of benign smooth muscle within veins outside the confines of a leiomyoma or even when no leiomyoma is present. There are two main theories regarding the pathogenesis of IVL. One states that the tumor arises from within the uterine veins, and the other states that it results from intravascular invasion by a leiomyoma. Rarely, these can extend through the pelvic and ovarian veins to the inferior vena cava and reach the right atrium of the heart. Due to their slow-growing nature, these tumors tend not to respond to conventional chemotherapy. Treatment options include total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salphingo-oopherectomy for uterine lesions, with resection of distant and intravenous lesions. The specimens should be measured for estrogen and progesterone receptors as estrogen is thought to play an important role in the growth and development of the disease.
Benign metastasizing leiomyoma is a rare disease first described by Steiner in 1939. The disease is characterized by uterine leiomyoma in young adulthood, with pulmonary metastases occurring in the pre-menopausal period. Benign metastasizing leiomyoma can have a benign indolent clinical course with long-term stability. Radiographically, benign metastasizing leiomyoma presents typically as solitary or multiple pulmonary nodules, and on CT these nodules enhance homogenously. Although the multiplicity of lesions raises the question of metastatic disease, in the clinical setting of a hormonally active woman with a history of uterine leiomyomas and no known primary malignancy, the radiologist can add benign metastasizing leiomyoma to the diagnostic considerations even before tissue sampling.

Inhalation of cryptococcal particles into the lungs is a route of pulmonary infection, and subsequent hematogenous dissemination may cause central nervous infection. 
Cryptococcal infections are mostly common in immunocompromized patients such as those with AIDS, who underwent organ transplantation, or who have a hematologic malignancy. These infections are relatively rare in immunocompetent patients.
The radiologic manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis are thought to be affected by the patient's level of immunosuppression.
Pulmonary cryptococcosis in AIDS patients tends to manifest itself as a disseminated thoracic disease with an interstitial lung pattern and lymph node enlargements: whereas the infection in immunocompetent hosts shows single or multiple nodular lesions or mass-like consolidation.
The most common manifestation of pulmonary cryptococcosis on CT was pulmonary nodules. Nodules were typically 5-20 mm in diameter, smoothly marginated, either solitary or multiple in number, and associated with other parenchymal findings such as masses and consolidation. Cavitation in nodules and masses has been previously described as a radiographic feature particularly in immunosuppressed patients.Ground-glass opacities adjacent to or surrounding nodules in an appearance consistent with the CT halo sign were present in 40% of patients presenting with a nodular pattern of disease. 
Pulmonary cryptococcosis is an indolent lung disease in non-AIDS patients that is slowly progressive in nature, even without adequate treatment.

At thoracotomy, the mass was removed, which is attached to the visceral pleura of the left upper lobe, could not be found a stalk. Histologically, the lesion was localized fibrous tumor of the pleura. 
","Localized fibrous tumors are slow growing, rare mesenchymal neoplasms that most commonly affect the pleura but have also been described in a number of other locations including the mediastinum and the lung. Clinically localized fibrous tumor of the pleura(LFTP) occurs in both sexes and in all age groups but predominantly affects persons more than 50 years old. Most patients are asymptomatic; cough, chest pain, and dyspnea occur occasionally, especially in association with large tumors. Extrathoracic manifestations include hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in 4-7 % and hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia, noted in less than 5% of patients, is usually associated with very large tumor and is thought to be due to glucose consumption by the mass.
On chest radiography, localized fibrous tumor of pleura is seen as round or oval mass, often lobulated, located at the pleural surface. And the mass often arise from the visceral pleura and are attached to the pleural surface by a pedicle. In such instances, they project freely into the pleural surface, and changes in position and shape can be observed on inspiration and expiration radiographs and/or fluoroscopy. CT findings include well-delineated, often lobulated non-calcified enhancing soft tissue mass in close relation to the pleural surface or fissure, and absence of chest wall invasion. The margin at the junction of the mass with the pleura usually tapers smoothly. These tumors predominate in the middle and lower half of the chest. Calcification has been reported in 7% of tumors. pleural effusion was present in 8-17% of cases but is more likely to be associated with malignant tumors than the benign.

Thoracoscopic wedge resection of the left lower lobe was done and the histology revealed intraluminal fibrosis involving respiratory bronchioles, multiple fibrous plugs and interstitial lymphoplasma cell infiltration, which suggests cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP). 
","Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP or BOOP) is a histologic description and not a specific diagnosis. BOOP is one of the more common causes of chronic interstitial lung disease. Etiologies of BOOP include toxic fume or dust inhalation (extrinsic allergic alveolitis), post infectious (mycoplasma, fungal, or viral), connective tissue disease, smoking, chronic graft-vs-host disease, organ transplantation, and drug toxicity (Amiodarone). BOOP has also been described in the contralateral lung following radiation therapy. Commonly an etiologic factor is not identified and the condition is idiopathic in up to 50% of cases. 
Idiopathic BOOP is also referred to as ""cryptogenic organizing pneumonia"". Most cases of idiopathic BOOP occur in patients between the ages of 40 and 60 years and there is no sex predilection. Patients generally present with a history of a flu-like illness prodrome with a dry, non-productive cough that lasts 2 to 12 weeks, malaise, gradual dyspnea, and a low-grade fever. Pulmonary function studies usually demonstrate restrictive abnormalities. The diagnosis should not be made without biopsy confirmation. There is no response to antibiotics, but the process often has a good response to treatment with steroids. Relapses may occur following cessation of steroid therapy in about one-third of cases. 
Imaging:
Chest radiograph: The radiologic manifestations of BOOP are those of an organizing pneumonia. On chest radiograph, there is bilateral patchy, peripheral alveolar infiltrates (organizing pneumonia) or ground glass opacities in over two-thirds of cases. The consolidations are predominantly subpleural in up to 50-60% of patients. Unilateral, focal, or lobar consolidations are seen less commonly. All lung zones may be affected. Diffuse small linear and nodular opacities are seen in 20-40% of cases. The disorder can progress to fibrosis, but honeycombing is usually absent. Effusions are noted in 10% of cases on plain film and adenopathy is not usually identified. 
Computed tomography: On HRCT, subpleural, patchy, basilar dense consolidations (80%) with air bronchograms and/or ground-glass densities (60%) producing a pattern of mosaic attenuation are the characteristic findings (in up to 50% of affected patients, especially the immune compromised), but this finding is non-specific as it may also be seen in chronic infection (TB, MAI), sarcoidosis, alveolar cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and chronic aspiration. Large, peripheral areas of irregularly marginated mass-like consolidation have also been described and may be seen in up to 20% of cases. Peribronchial thickening is common. Centrilobular nodular densities ranging in size from 1 to 10 mm (sometimes larger), which may be well or poorly defined, may also be seen (30-50% of cases) and correlate with areas of organizing pneumonia. Adenopathy is more commonly noted by CT (25%) and effusion is found in up to 30% of cases. The presence of dense consolidations helps to distinguish BOOP from DIP, and fibrosis is also not observed in BOOP.

Underlying bone involvement is seen in 6%?7% of patients, typically with pressure erosion and cortical scalloping but without invasion of the medullary canal. Bone scintigraphy usually demonstrates increased uptake on blood pool and static images. Angiograms are variable in appearance, often showing marked hypervascularity, although some lesions demonstrate no vascular blush. CT scans of the deep fibromatoses are also usually nonspecific. Lesions may be hypoattenuating relative to skeletal muscle but are typically isoattenuating or even hyperattenuating. The latter finding may be related to lesions with more extensive collagen. Lesions usually demonstrate enhancement after intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material; the enhancement is sometimes marked. Owing to the infiltrative growth pattern and the attenuation similar to that of skeletal muscle, the margins of the lesion are often indistinct at CT unless it is separated from normal tissue by a fat plane. Subtle pressure erosions of bone are often better evaluated on radiographs owing to beam-hardening artifact at CT.
The best imaging modality for evaluation and staging of the deep fibromatoses is MR imaging. Extraabdominal desmoid tumors are typically intermuscular lesions, although muscle invasion is common. In addition, linear extension along fascial planes is a frequent manifestation and is uncommon with other soft-tissue neoplasms. Initial reports suggested that the lesions have decreased signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images. The MR imaging pattern of the deep fibromatoses has been highly variable. The most common signal intensity pattern is heterogeneous, with intermediate signal intensity (similar to that of fat on T2-weighted images and similar to that of skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images) seen with standard pulse sequences. The heterogeneous signal intensity pattern likely corresponds to the varying proportions of cellular tissue, myxoid tissue (high water content and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images), and collagen (low signal intensity with all pulse sequences) in the lesion. Prominent low-signal-intensity bands are often seen with all pulse sequences and are likely related to the dense areas of collagen. Areas of low signal intensity with all pulse sequences are characteristic of fibromatosis but not specific for it. Other types of soft-tissue masses with prominent low signal intensity on T2-weighted images include giant cell tumor of tendon sheath (a localized form of pigmented villonodular synovitis), calcified masses, and malignancies such as fibrosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The deep fibromatoses typically demonstrate moderate to marked enhancement after administration of gadolinium contrast material particularly in less collagenized and more cellular regions. Only 10% of lesions lack significant enhancement at MR imaging. Lesion margins at MR imaging may be well defined or infiltrative.

It is well-demarcated and abuts posterior pleura. No abnormal abnormality is seen in the chest wall and both lungs. There is no evidence of significant lymphadenopathy in mediastinum. ,"The patient underwent surgical mass excision. There was no evidence of pleural adhesion or other pleural abnormality. Cystic mass was seen in the posterior mediastinum. No significantly enlarged systemic artery from descending thoracic aorta was seen. On the pathologic report, final diagnosis was extralobar pulmonary sequestration with cystic bronchial dilatation.

Extralobar sequestration is a congenital anomaly, representing approximately 15%-25% of all pulmonary sequestrations. It is invested in its own pleura, consists of lung tissue that lacks a normal communication to the tracheobronchial tree and derives its blood supply from systemic vessels. Arterial supply is usually from the abdominal aorta and drainage is almost always by means of systemic veins (azygos, hemiazygos and inferior vena cava), producing a left-to-right shunt. 
Approximately 10% of extralobar sequestrations are found incidentally in asymptomatic individuals. About 50%-65% of patients with extralobar sequestration have associated congenital anomalies. The most common associated congenital anomaly is congenital diaphragmatic hernia (20%-30% of cases).
Chest radiographs often show a single homogeneous opacity or, less commonly, a cystic mass in the base of one lung that can sometimes suggest the diagnosis of sequestration. Characteristic CT manifestations are (a) a complex lesion containing solid or fluid components combined with emphysematous lung or (b) any basal lesion supplied by a systemic artery. CT angiography can facilitate the display of aberrant artery and venous drainage may not be clearly shown on CT. However, supplying artery may not been seen on CT, if it may be as small as 1mm, especially in infants.
Surgery is generally indicated for the treatment. It is important to demonstrate the arterial supply and venous drainage of the sequestered segment preoperatively. Embolization of the anomalous vessels with angiographic techniques may be helpful in reducing operative blood loss.

","Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease of uncertain aetiology and is well recognized in children. Functionally, Langerhans cells are antigen-presenting cells normally distributed in the skin, lymph nodes, bronchial mucosa, and thymus. Patients with LCH are currently categorized as (a) those with single system disease affecting a single site; (b) single system disease affecting multiple sites; (c) multisystem disease. In addition, isolated pulmonary LCH affecting adults was categorized as an LCH variant [1, 2].
Multisystem LCH is characterized by granulomatous infiltration of the lung, bone, skin, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, brain, kidneys, and endocrine system. Children and adult patients share several features, though the proportion with lung involvement is higher in adults, which may be explained by cigarette smoking. It is currently recommended that staging evaluation of LCH should include a bone scan, skeletal X-ray of suspicious bone lesions, a chest X-ray, and an abdominal ultrasound. This case was confirmed with neck lymph node biopsy. 
Pulmonary involvement may occur as part of multisystem LCH or isolated pulmonary LCH (PLCH), which accounts for approximately 20% of adult LCH patients [1, 3]. . In PLCH, the nodules are non-clonal, which partly accounts for its classification as variant LCH with up to 95% of adults with PLCH cigarette smokers.

The pathologic features are similar to those found in fat necrosis in epiploic appendagitis, omentum, and breast. 
Epipericardial fat necrosis debuts with acute chest pain, which is usually self-limiting and sometimes recurs several days later. Symptoms usually last several weeks.
Radiologic findings: Posteroanterior chest radiography usually shows a paracardiac opacity, occurring predominantly on the left side. Associated pleural effusion may occur. The main CT features in epipericardiac fat necrosis are an encapsulated fatty lesion with inflammatory changes such as dense strands, thickening of the adjacent pericardium, or both. Together with acute chest pain, these findings form a triad highly suggestive of the diagnosis of fat necrosis.

Chest PA shows marked improvement of patchy GGOs in both lung fields.","Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is an acute severe febrile illness associated with rapidly increasing shortness of breath and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings of acute respiratory failure and presence of markedly elevated numbers of eosinophils in BAL fluid. Peripheral blood eosinophile percentages are usually normal, although they become elevated during the subsequent clinical course. The majority of cases are idiopathic. Occasionally, it may result from drug reaction or inhalation exposure to smoke, particularly cigarette smoke. Tobacco smoke has been shown to be a trigger for acute eosinophilic pneumonia, especially in new-onset smokers. Patients respond rapidly to high doses of corticosteroids, usually within 24 hrs.

Typical radiographic finding is diffuse bilateral reticular opacities with or without patchy consolidation and pleural effusion. On chest CT, it shows findings of bilateral patchy area of ground glass opacity and consolidation accompanied with poorly defined nodules and smooth interlobular septal thickening. Pleural effusion is commonly combined.

The radiologic differential diagnosis for AEP includes hydrostatic pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome or acute interstitial pneumonia, and atypical bacterial or viral pneumonia. However, developing a clinicoradiologic differential diagnosis for AEP is often difficult because initial peripheral blood eosinophil counts are usually normal.

","Madelung disease (also known as Launois-Bensaude syndrome, benign symmetric lipomatosis, and multiple symmetric lipomatosis) is a rare disease of lipodystrophy characterized by the presence of multiple, symmetric, enormous, progressive, unencapsulated fatty accumulations diffusely involving the cheeks, the neck, the upper trunk, the shoulder girdle area, and the upper extremities. Madelung disease has been seen most often in men (male-to-female ratio, 15:1) between 30 and 60 years of age. There is an increased prevalence of this disease in the Mediterranean population, and there is a relationship between this condition and excessive alcohol consumption, particularly red wine. Madelung disease has been associated with alcoholism in 60% to 90% of patients, although the cause of this syndrome is unknown. Hyperuricemia, gout, liver disease, polyneuropathy, diabetes mellitus, glucose intolerance, peripheral insulin resistance, renal tubular acidosis, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia have occasionally been identified in patients with Madelung disease, some of whom have no history of alcoholism.
The long-term lipomatous deposits are often large and cosmetically deforming, and the upper aerodigestive tract and great veins may be compressed, which can cause dyspnea, dysphagia, and more serious complications, such as superior vena cava obstruction and sudden death in advanced cases. Despite the cosmetic aspect of the patient with a reduced range of motion of the head and neck, Madelung disease is often asymptomatic in most cases.
The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of history, clinical appearances, and imaging examination. Radiologic manifestations of Madelung disease were multiple and symmetric lipomatosis and calcification/ossification within lipomatous masses. Other imaging findings include a relative paucity of fat in the mediastinum, pericardium, abdomen, and pelvis.
Clinical management of Madelung disease involves abstinence from alcohol; however, there is only a slight regression in the magnitude of lipomatous deposits. Surgery is the other component of treatment. It is important to know the extent and distribution of the abnormally proliferated fat, the compression of abnormal fat tissue to major head and neck vessels, trachea and esophagus, and so on before operation.

Pulmonary involvement is relatively infrequent, have been reported 5% to 10% of cases. Aneurysms of the pulmonary arteries, otherwise an uncommon entity, are a typical manifestation of Behcet disease. In fact, Behcet disease is the most common cause of pulmonary artery aneurysm.

Pulmonary artery thrombosis as in this case may be associated with focal pulmonary hemorrhage. Hemoptysis may occur due to leakage or rupture of an aneurysm and may be life threatening. Therefore, aneurysm formation in the pulmonary arteries indicates a poor prognosis. 
No randomized controlled studies have evaluated treatment options for pulmonary vasculitis with Behcet disease. Colchicine has been recommended as a basic treatment, but a recent controlled trial has again confirmed that this pharmacotherapy is only effective relieving erythema nodosum and urogenital ulceration. Various treatment modalities in pulmonary aneurysm include imunosuppressive drugs alone or in combination with steroids, surgery, and endovascular embolization. In case of massive hemoptysis, surgery or endovascular embolization is necessary. To avoid pulmonary amputation, aneurysmectomy or occlusion of the arterial defect by direct suture was applied.

Chest CT images show multiple, well-defined, round or irregular nodules less than 1cm in both lungs with perivascular, subpleural distribution. Enhancement pattern is not conclusive because of the small size of the nodules. 
","Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), previously known as intravascular bronchoalveolar tumor, is a rare disease. It is more common among young women and typically presents as bilateral multiple nodules. Only rare EHE develops as a solitary lung nodule.
It can arise from many organ systems, including liver, bone, and soft tissues simultaneously or sequentially. 
Chest pain, cough, and sputum are common symptoms and only few patients present with an alveolar hemorrhage at diagnosis .
The most characteristic feature of EHE on chest radiograph or CT is the presence of multiple perivascular nodules with well- or ill-defined margins in both lungs [1]. Radiologic calcification is not common, but histologic examinations often reveal calcified and ossified necrotic centers of the nodules. 
Differential diagnosis includes metastatic carcinoma, chronic granulomatous disease, less commonly multiple benign tumors, vasculitis or bronchiolitis rarely. And in children, Histiocytosis X can be considered [3].
Bearing the metastatic nature of this entity in mind, the diagnosis should be followed by a search for sclerosing vascular tumors elsewhere. Extrapulmonary spread of the tumor has been mainly described in the liver. There is no clear standard for treatment, but with lesions being small and limited in number, surgical resection is recommended.

","Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease characterized by accumulation of protein- and lipid-rich material resembling surfactant within the parenchymal airspaces. More than 90% of cases occur as acquired disease of unknown etiology that appears to be related to the presence of an antibody to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.  Clinical symptoms are variable, ranging from mild progressive dyspnea to respiratory failure. 
The characteristic radiographic pattern of PAP consists of bilateral patchy areas of consolidation that have a vaguely nodular appearance. The CT appearance of crazy-paving, defined as a network of smoothly thickened septal lines superimposed on areas of ground-glass opacity. Areas of crazy-paving in PAP are typically widespread and bilateral, often with sharply-marginated areas of geographic or lobular sparing. The radiologic differential diagnoses of crazy-paving include pulmonary edema, pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphangitic carcinomatosis.  Its subpleural and peribronchial distribution like this case appears to be unusual for PAP.
Definitive diagnosis is made with lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage, with specimens that reveal intraalveolar deposits of proteinaceous material, dissolved cholesterol, and eosinophilic globules. Symptomatic treatment includes whole-lung lavage and multiple procedures may be required.

This lesion showed as the multiple cystic lesions on the chest CT scanned on 8 years ago.,"A congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), historically referred to congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAM), is a rare developmental, non-hereditary, hamartomatous abnormality of the lung. CPAM constitutes up to 25% of congenital cystic lung lesions. 80~85% of cases are diagnosed in the first 2 years of life, rarely, the presentation is delayed until adulthood. Clinically, adults most frequently present with recurrent or persistent pulmonary infections. Other modes of presentation include hemoptysis, hemothorax, pneumothorax, pyopneumothorax, shortness of breath or as an incidental finding on a chest radiograph.
Radiological abnormalities range from a soft-tissue mass containing single or multiple air-filled cysts of varying sizes to a solid homogeneous mass that may be mistaken for a lung abscess or pneumonia.
After the morphologic description in 1975, Stocker et al. classified CPAM into three subtypes based on the clinical, gross and histological features. Type I is the most commonly encountered (50~70% of cases) with single or multiple large cysts (2 cm in diameter). Type II lesions (approximately 40% of cases) are characterized by multiple small cysts less than 2 cm in diameter (rarely larger). Type III lesions are rare (approximately 3% of cases). It usually shows as a bulky, solid mass. 
Because the majority of cases are associated with recurrent infection and risk for development of carcinoma, Treatment of CPAM is usually surgical, involving complete resection of the relevant part of the lung.

A dumbell-shaped lesion was found on chest CT, which straddled across the right anterior chest wall. The lesion showed low attenuation as much as the air in the lung (figure 1). On bone window setting, chest CT demonstrates non-union of old fracture involving anterior arc of right 3rd rib (figure 2). When tracing the lesion up and down, the low attenuated lesion was continuous with lung parenchyma in the thorax and connecting pulmonary vessels were squeezed through the slit of non-union of right 3rd rib. Figure 3 is a 3D reconstructed image with SSD (surface shaded display)-technique. The communication between the herniated lung and intrathoracic lung parenchyma is nicely demonstrated on this 3D volume image.","Herniation of the lung and pleural membranes outside of the bony thorax is a rare occurrence. Broadly, the etiology is either congenital (accounting for 18% of cases) or acquired. When congenital, the hernia is caused by rib or intercostal hypoplasia or agenesis. An acquired extrathoracic lung hernia can be either caused by trauma (52% of cases), which is more often penetrating than blunt injury, or spontaneously acquired (30% of cases).These hernias can be asymptomatic and uncomplicated; therefore, presentation can be delayed. Presentation in these individuals occurs with a slowly enlarging fluctuant swelling more conspicuous on Valsalva manoeuvre. 
	Plain chest radiography may produce only subtle findings. Bony or joint trauma may be seen. Owing to the sharply defined density difference between herniated aerated lung and the surrounding chest wall soft tissues, the hernia itself may be apparent. The absence of contrast within the vessels of a herniated lung on contrast-enhanced CT can be taken as an indication of strangulation and therefore of imminently at-risk lung or already non-viable lung. Management decisions depend on whether the herniated lung is viable, the patient’s condition, and the site, type and size of the thoracic wall defect. Conservative treatment relies upon spontaneous regression of the hernia. Serial clinical and imaging examinations are vital for the conservatively managed patient.

 Mediastinal setting of chest CT images (Fig 5-6) show small amount of bilateral pleural effusion and mild LN enlargement in mediastinum and subcarinal area. 
","Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) represents a clinical entity that is distinct from other idiopathic eosinophilic lung diseases. Diagnostic criteria include acute febrile illness of less than 5 days of duration; hypoxemia; diffuse alveolar or mixed alveolar-interstitial opacities on chest radiographs; BAL fluid consisting of more than 25% eosinophils; absence of parasitic, fungal, or other infection; prompt and complete response to corticosteroids; and no relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroids. Peripheral blood eosinophils percentages are usually normal, although they become elevated during the subsequent clinical course. Unlike with blood eosinophils, a very high percentage of BAL eosinophils is characteristic of AEP. Patients respond rapidly to high doses of corticosteroids, usually within 24 hrs.

Typical radiographic finding is diffuse bilateral reticular opacities with or without patchy consolidation and pleural effusion. On chest CT, it shows findings of bilateral patchy area of ground glass opacity and consolidation accompanied with poorly defined nodules and smooth interlobular septal thickening. Pleural effusion is commonly combined.

The radiologic differential diagnosis for AEP includes hydrostatic pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome or acute interstitial pneumonia, and atypical bacterial or viral pneumonia.

Fibrofolliculomas usually appear as multiple, dome-shaped, whitish papules in the face (4, 5). Patients with BHD syndrome have a 7-fold increased risk of developing renal neoplasm and the most life-threatening complication of BHD syndrome is renal cancer (4, 6). More than 80% of adult patients with BHD syndrome have multiple lung cysts. Despite the presence of multiple lung cysts, lung function is usually unaffected (7). The histology of pleuropulmonary lesions include intraparenchymal collections of air surrounded by normal parenchyma or a thin fibrous wall and blebs within the pleura (8). Patients with BHD syndrome have a 50-fold increased risk of spontaneous pneumothorax (6).
Clinical diagnosis of BHD syndrome requires a fulfillment of one major or two minor criteria.

Solitary (localized) fibrous tumors in the pleura were first described by Klemperer and Rabin in 1931. Solitary fibrous tumors (SFT) are uncommon neoplasms of mesenchymal origin that can be benign or malignant. Although SFT most commonly occur in the pleura, numerous extrapleural sites of involvement have been reported. SFT most commonly present during the fifth and sixth decades of life, and there is no significant sex predilection. The most common extrapleural sites of the tumor are the orbits and the extremities. Tumors are often well-circumscribed masses, and vary in size from 1 cm to over 30 cm. The admixture of histological components in the tumor, namely, fibrous tissue, cellular components, and highly vascularized areas consisting of numerous closely packed small to medium-sized blood vessels, influence the imaging appearances of the tumor. The attenuation likely depends on the collagen content, in which hyperdense lesions have abundant collagen. The presence or absence of calcifications is not necessarily a helpful distinguishing feature. In addition, there is considerable overlap in the type of enhancement at CT, during which 100% of malignant and 60% of benign SFT exhibit heterogeneous enhancement. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor is suggested by a well-circumscribed mass that has smooth margins, and focal or diffuse hypointense signal on T2-weighted imaging due to fibrous content in the tumor. SFTs demonstrate strong focal or diffuse contrast enhancement due to the highly vascularized areas in the tumor.

Interposition of lung tissue is noted between the pulmonary trunk and LAA.
","Congenital absence of the pericardium is rare. Most pericardial defects are partial and occur on the left side. Normally, the aortopulmonary window is covered by pericardium and contains some fat. Left-sided absence of the pericardium allows interposition of lung tissue between the aorta and the main segment of the pulmonary artery. Occasionally, there is bulging of the left atrial appendage through the defect. The heart usually rotates toward the left.

Non-contrast CT scans (Figure 2 & 3) demostrate subpleural consolidations and GGOs in both lungs, especially both lower lobes, of which attenuation is higher than vascular attenuation in the mediastinum (Figure 4). The attenuation of the liver is high on non-contrast CT (Figure 5), raising the suspicion of iodine deposition in patients with history of amiodarone medication.
The patient has been treated with amiodarone because of atrial fibrillation for 1 year. Treatment was the cessation of amiodarone medication. On three months follow up (Figure 6), the consolidation is markedly decreased in extent in this patient.
","Amiodarone is an iodinated compound used to treat life threatening cardiac dysrrhythmia, pulmonary toxicity occurs in 5 to 10% of treated patients. Toxicity is dose related and is more likely to occur with doses greater than 400 mg/day. 
The most common clinical presentation consists of subacute onset of nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and weight loss; this presentation appears on HRCT 1) Commonly, as diffuse interstitial thickening and interstitial fibrosis (NSIP predominantly composed of mononuclear cells, foamy alveolar macrophages, type II cell hyperplasia, and fibrosis), 2) Less commonly, as nodular areas of subpleural consolidation (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia). Another less common presentation consists of acute onset of dyspnea associated with fever; this presentation appears on HRCT as areas of dependent consolidation. Amiodarone is an iodine-containing compound; therefore, parenchymal lesions often show high attenuation, with a range from 82 to 174 HU.  Although this finding is helpful in suggesting amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity, it is not pathognomonic. Discontinuation of therapy typically is associated with a good prognosis.

","Bronchial atresia is characterized by focal interruption of lobar, segmental, or subsegmental bronchus associated peripheral mucus impaction and hyperinflation of the obstructed lung segment. The common sites of involvement in bronchial atresia are the apicoposterior segmental bronchus of the left upper lobe and segmental bronchi of the right upper lobe, middle lobe, and occasionally the lower lobe. Pathogenesis may relate to intrauterine interruption of bronchial arterial blood supply, resulting in ischemia and scarring or discontinuity between the cells at the tip of a bronchial bud with the bud itself. The distal branches can develop normally in the absence of a connection between the distal and central airways. The radiographic features include a hilar mass and hyperinflation of the peripheral lung secondary to entrapment of air admitted via collateral air drift. The dilated bronchi contain retained secretions and can have a varied appearance. The characteristic CT features are as follows: The supplying bronchus is atretic, and there is a hilar mass. The dilated bronchi beyond the atresia are completely opaque or demonstrate air-fluid levels or occasionally may be purely air filled.

On pathologic examination, respiratory epithelium was aligned with the wall of cystic mass, which was consistent with bronchogenic cyst.","Bronchogenic cysts are congenital lesions thought to result from abnormal budding of the embryonic foregut. Mediastinal cysts are far more frequent and do not communicate with the bronchial tree, unlike intraparenchymal cysts in which such communications usually develop, leading to frequent recurrent infection. 
At computed tomography (CT), bronchogenic cysts typically manifest as spherical masses of either water or soft-tissue attenuation. However, in one-half of all bronchogenic cysts, the CT density can vary from a low soft-tissue range to higher-than-muscle density, likely due to intracystic hemorrhage, protein, or calcium.
In one report, 68 histopathologically proven cases of bronchogenic cyst were analyzed. There were 58 mediastinal and 10 extramediastinal cysts (85% vs. 15%). Most common location of bronchogenic cyst is carinal area (52%), followed by paratracheal area (19%), esophageal wall (14%) and retrocardiacl area (9%). Especially, the extramediastinal cysts were located in the lung parenchyma (7/10), the diaphragm (2/10) and the pleura in one case. Rarely several cases in retroperitoneal bronchogenic cyst were reported. 
On MR scan, bronchogenic cysts shows variable signal instensity which are slightly hyperintense or isointense to skeletal muscle on T1WI and isointense or hyperintense to CSF. These thin-walled cysts are lined with respiratory epithelium and cyst fluid is composed primarily of water admixed with varying amounts of thick proteinaceous mucus. Calcium oxalate crystals have also been detected in the fluid.

Kartagener syndrome is a rare genetic birth defect. Individuals with Kartagener syndrome have abnormal or absent ciliary motion. Kartagener syndrome is also called Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, and Immotile Cilia Syndrome, Afzelius syndrome, Kartagener triad, Zivert syndrome, and Zivert-Kartagener triad. Cilia are tiny hair-like structures that are present on the surfaces of many different types of cells. One of the functions of cilia is to move mucus out of the respiratory passages. During infections, more mucus is produced and because the abnormal cilia can't move or move ineffectively, mucus becomes stuck and blocks the respiratory tract, causing various complications. Some common symptoms of Kartagener syndrome are chronic rhinitis, recurrent or chronic sinusitis, recurrent or chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, olfactory impairment, and infertility. Treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms and slowing disease progression. Complications of Kartagener syndrome include bronchiectasis, difficulty breasthing, and chronic wheezing and coughing. Bronchiectasis occurs when the bronchial tubes are blocked and chronically infected, causing the tubes to weaken and stretch out. The widened tubes allow more mucus and bacteria to accumulate, leading to infection and possibly pneumonia.

Intrathoracic EMH may manifest as a paraosseous mass, interstitial pulmonary abnormality, pleural mass, or hemothorax, either alone or in combination. 
Mediastinal lesions most commonly occur in the posterior mediastinum due to herniation of myeloid tissue through the thin cortical bone of the posterior ribs and/or activation of extramyeloid hematopoietic cells. The paraspinal masses and rib expansion are the most common manifestation of intrathoracic EMH.   
The paraspinal masses have to be differentiated from lymphadenopathy and neurogenic tumors. Cases of EMH involving the pulmonary interstitium mimick an inflammatory or neoplastic diffuse interstitial process and have occasionally resulted in cardiopulmonary insufficiency. EMH usually regresses or disappears after treatment with blood transfusion and hydroxyurea, splenectomy in cases of spherocytosis, or radiation therapy.

A small percentage                     of patients, also typically women, have LAM in association with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).  LAM is characterized by the abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle cells (LAM cells) in the lungs and in the thoracic and retroperitoneal lymphatics. Affected patients are at risk of developing renal hamartomas or angiomyolipomas. Patients with LAM characteristically present with chronic dyspnea and cough and less commonly with spontaneous pneumothorax.
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex is an inheritable autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multifocal systemic hamartomas that may affect the central nervous system, skin, heart, kidneys, and other organs.  The Vogt triad of epileptic seizures, mental retardation, and facial angioﬁbromas (formerly misnamed as adenoma sebaceum) is exhibited by only approximately 29% of affected patients.
Relationship between TSC and LAM;  Although histologic and clinical features may be identical in women with LAM and patients with TSC-associated pulmonary involvement, there are reported differences. Patients with TSC- associated LAM, compared with patients with sporadic LAM, generally experience a longer delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of pulmonary disease, exhibit chylothoraces less frequently, and are more likely to present with gradual onset of dyspnea.
Radiographic abnormalities in patients with LAM have been reported as a pattern of generalized, symmetric, reticular, or reticulonodular opacities, seen in approximately 80%-90% of affected patients. Lung volumes have been reported as normal at chest radiography in 55%-78% of affected patients and increased in 22%-45%.  Pneumothorax is a common clinical and radiographic presenting manifestation of LAM, reported in 39%-53% of patients. Pleural effusion (secondary to chylothorax) is a common radiographic feature, occurring in 10%-20% of patients, and may be unilateral or bilateral.
The CT manifestations of LAM are distinctive, characterized by numerous thin-walled cysts surrounded by normal lung parenchyma and distributed diffusely and bilaterally. Occasionally, a chylous effusion is suggested at chest CT based on low-attenuation (- 17HU) fluid that may relate to the presence of fat. 
Renal angiomyolipomas have been observed on abdominal CT scans of 20%-54% of patients with LAM. These tumors are characterized by CT evidence of soft tissue, fat, and enhancing vessels in variable proportions within a renal mass. 
A variety of intracranial manifestations of TS are known. Four common CNS abnormalities are cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SGCAs), and white matter abnormalities. Except for SGCAs, these abnormalities can be seen in almost all patients with TS.

After 6 months’ medication for Tbc, the anterior mediastinal necrotic mass considerably decreased in size. Mediastinal or hilar tuberculous lymphadenitis is a frequent manifestation of primary tuberculosis both in children and in adults. In mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis, those patients with large nodes and with symptoms generally have positive disease whereas those patients with small nodes and no symptoms have negative disease. However, in pediatric, geriatric and immunocompromised populations, patients can have no systemic symptoms despite active disease and patients with inactive disease may have large calcified nodes and symptoms due to illness other than tuberculosis. Biopsy and culture of the diseased nodes are considered the gold standard for determination of disease activity in patients with mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis.
Patients proven to have active disease had CT findings of nodes with central low attenuation and peripheral rim enhancement that corresponded pathologically to caseation or liquefaction necrosis and granulation tissue
with inflammatory hypervascularity, respectively. With treatment, nodes changed in appearance on follow-up studies, first becoming homogeneous and finally disappearing or resuIting in a residual mass composed of fibrotic tissue and calcifications.

The penetration of juvenile worms through the diaphragm into the pleural cavity can cause pleural effusion (37%) or pneumothorax (17%). The most common findings on CT consist of subpleural or subfissural single or multiple nodules 1-4 cm that frequently contain a necrotic low attenuation area or cavitation. There are commonly associated subpleural linear opacities and focal pleural thickening adjacent to a pulmonary nodule. The appearance of pulmonary lesions is influenced by the stage of the infection and the surrounding tissue reaction. Early findings are caused by the migration of juvenile worms and focal airspace consolidation, linear opacities, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or hydoropneumothorax. Later findings result from worm cysts and include thin walled cysts, mass-like consolidation, nodules, and bronchiectasis. CT also may show a subpleural streaky opacity 2-7 mm thick and 5-60 mm long connecting the pleura and the nodule, which is presumed to be a worm migration track (burrow track).

Plain radiographs are relatively insensitive in detecting metastatic calcification. In some patients, ill-defined nodules, or patchy areas of increased opacity may be seen. They may or may not appear to be of calcium density. CT can show areas of ground glass opacity, consolidation, or calcification. Numerous fluffy and poorly defined nodules, measuring 3 to 10 mm in diameter, are typical, but opacities can appear focal, lobular, patchy, or diffuse. Even with HRCT, these opacities may not appear calcified. An apical predominance is common, because the apices are more alkaline than the bases, increasing the likelihood of calcium salt precipitation in this region.

LCH is an abnormal nonmalignant
proliferation of monoclonal Langerhans cells within one or multiple organ systems. Although the etiology of LCH is unknown, theories include viral infection, antigen exposure, and somatic mutation. Pulmonary LCH refers to LCH isolated to the respiratory system, notably the lungs. This rare disease is found almost exclusively in cigarette smokers, which supports the theory of antigen
exposure, since cigarette smoke contains thousands of known antigens. Pulmonary LCH appears to begin in the third to fourth decade of life, but a patient with mild to moderate disease may not receive a diagnosis until later. The most common clinical symptoms include dyspnea, cough, and fatigue, although patients may present with chest pain caused by a pneumothorax. For most patients, symptom stabilization occurs with smoking cessation alone. 
The radiologic findings of pulmonary LCH vary depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Diffuse bilateral ill-defined nodules will be seen in early stages. Because the disease has an inhalational component, the middle and upper lung zones are involved to a greater extent than the lung bases. It is thought that these nodules undergo cystic degeneration as the disease progresses, and so a reticular pattern begins to predominate on chest radiographs as the numerous cystic walls are superimposed on one another. The cysts and residual parenchyma can undergo fibrosis over time and eventually lead to changes of honeycombing. On HRCT, many cysts appear round, they can also have bizarre shapes, being bilobed, cloverleaf shaped, or branching in appearance. These unusual shapes are postulated to occur because of fusion of several cysts, perhaps because the cysts sometimes represent ecstatic and thick-walled bronchi. In some patients, cysts are the only abnormality visible on HRCT, small nodule are also present. They were usually smaller than 5mm in diameter. Larger nodules, sometimes exceeding 1cm, may also be seen, but they are less common. The margins of nodules are often irregular, particularly when there is surrounding cystic or reticular disease. Many nodules can be seen to be peribronchial or peribronchiolar and therefore centrilobular in location. The nodules are usually homogenous in appearance, but some nodules, particulary those large than 1cm in diameter, may show lucent centers, presumably corresponding to small cavities. HRCT image classically shows upper to mid lung zone predominance in size and number of nodules or cysts with sparing area of costophrenic angles. Phenotypically, LCs express surface CD1a glycoprotein and cytoplasmic S-100 protein, although the latter is not specific.

Mucormycosis occurs almost invariably in patients who are not fully inmmunocompetent. Patients with diabetes, a renal transplant, or a hematologic malignancy are particularly susceptible. Mucormycosis may present as an infection of the upper respiratory tract (particularly the sinuses) or the lungs. Individuals with pulmonary mucormycosis tend to be more severely immunosuppressed, for example recipients of bone marrow transplantation.
The most common radiographic abnormality is lobar consolidation. The consolidation may be multilobar but can be focal and mass-like lesion. Occasionally there may be pleural effusions or hilar lymphadenopathy. Because of the angioinvasive nature of mucormycosis, the mass-like lesions may accompany the peripheral halo on CT (CT-halo sign), representing the perilesional hemorrhage, pathologically. Once infarction has occurred, cavitation within the necrotic lung ensues.
Treatment for mucormycosis depends on antifungal agents, surgery, and control of predisposing conditions.

","Elastofibromas dorsi are benign fibroelastic lesions, most commonly found in the periscapular region. The tumor had a reported prevalence of 2% in a study of patients over 60 years old who were undergoing chest CT for evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma.
It is classically found in the infrascapular regions, deep to the serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi musculature. Unilateral masses have a slight right-sided predilection, but up to 60% of elastofibromas are bilateral. Elastofibroma dorsi is most frequently seen in older women, with a reported female predilection of 5-13:1 and a mean age at diagnosis of 65-70 years.
At clinical examination, elastofibroma dorsi is often asymptomatic. In up to 50% of patients, however, elastofibroma dorsi may cause moderate pain and clicking, snapping, or clunking of the scapula with movement. 
Occasionally, elastofibroma dorsi manifests with shoulder pain and is misdiagnosed clinically as a rotator cuff tendon tear or subacromial bursitis. Most patients in whom symptomatic masses are surgically excised remain free of symptoms. Recurrence has been reported to occur on rare occasions but is thought to be secondary to incomplete excision.
The CT appearance of elastofibroma dorsi is diagnostic. A poorly defined soft-tissue mass in the infrascapular or subscapular region with attenuation similar to that of the adjacent skeletal muscle is seen. These masses have been reported to have soft-tissue attenuation at CT with internal striations or scattered areas of fat attenuation.

The patient was confirmed with ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis, named “Wegener granulomatosis” in the past, by VATs lung biopsy; pathologic findings are vasculitis, multifocal necrosis and micro-abscess formation, granuloma and scattered giant cell.
","ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis (AGV) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that usually involves upper airway disease (almost always involvement; nasal, oral, or sinus inflammation from chronic sinusitis to septal perforation), lower respiratory airway disease (90%; lung), kidney (80%; from segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis to rarely RCC) and other less common organs including skin-purpura, PNS-sensory neuropathy and cardiac involvement. Lung biopsy of AGV shows a granulomatous small-vessel necrotizing vasculitis. AGV most commonly occurs in whites and affects men and women equally and the mean age is 40 years. Elevation of serum cytoplasmic antineutrophil antibodies against protease 3 in cytoplasmic granules(c-ANCA) is positive more than 90% of patients with active stage of AGV. Patients with AGV have respiratory symptom such as hemoptysis, cough and dyspnea.
CT is sensitive for detection of lung involvement. Lung nodules and masses are the most common manifestation of AGV (40~70%) presenting multiply, bilaterally and without a zonal predilection and usually measuring between 2 and 4cm. The CT halo sign (a rim of GGO surrounding a nodule) is seen in 15% and most noncavitated nodules or masses show central low attenuation reflecting extensive central necrosis. The nodules may occur in a centrilobular distribution. Cavitation with thin or thick wall occurs in 25% of nodules larger than 2 cm. Approximately 50% of the nodules and masses resolve responding to treatment, 40% decrease in size and 10% remain unchanged. If air-fluid level in cavity is more suggestive of pulmonary infection rather than primary cavity of AGV.
Airspace consolidation and ground-glass opacity (20-50%) may result from alveolar hemorrhage or pneumonitis. They may have a random distribution, a peribronchial distribution, or appear as peripheral wedge-shaped lesions mimicking pulmonary infarction.
Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage occurs in 10% of patients with AGV, airway involvement in 15-25% as form of subglottic tracheal and/or bronchial stenosis in the central airways. 
Although pathogenesis is unclear, the immunosuppression with corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide is the best current therapy (remission rate; 87%). In April 2011, the FDA approved rituximab (a chimeric antibody to CD20 protein) in combination with steroids to treat patients with WG, but relapse is still common.

","Castleman’s disease(CD) is an uncommon benign lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles. Two histological types are described: hyaline-vascular type and plasma cell type. From a clinical stand point, CD is also classified as localized or multicentric.
The hyaline-vascular type of CD occurs in up to 90% of cases. Patients with the hyaline-vascular type are usually children or young adults and up to 70% of them have an asymptomatic, localized mediastinal mass. On the other hand, the plasma cell variety often presents as a multicentric process, associated with generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. It often results in a systemic illness, associated with fever, anemia, infections, and malignancies such as lymphoma or Kaposi’s sarcoma.
On contrast-enhanced CT, localized CD typically shows dense contrast enhancement; any mediastinal compartment can be involved. Central, dense, or flocculent lymph node calcifications are occasionally seen. Patients with multicentric CD have shown early, dense, uniform enhancement of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Axillary, abdominal, and other lymph node groups may also be involved.

Bronchoscopy with biopsy was performed. Right main bronchus was nearly obstructed by polypoid necrotic mass with fibrin materials. GMS stain reveals many fungal organisms(not shown).
"," Invasive aspergillosis is one of the most common fungal infections in immunocompromised hosts, involving the respiratory tract in 90% of cases. The most common form of aspergillus species infection in immunocompromised patients is invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, which mainly involves the lung parenchyma and, rarely, the trachebronchial tree. Infection confined only to the tracheobronchial tree is known as invasive aspergillus tracheobronchitis (IATB), and it generally carries an ominous prognosis(1). 
 Three morpholgical variants of IATB have been described:obstructive tracheobronchitis, ulcerative tracheobronchitis and pseudomembranous necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis (PNBA) [6,8,9]. The obstructive form is characterized by massive intraluminal growth of aspergillus
species associated with thick mucus plugs that generally produce atelectasis. Ulcerative lesions penetrate through the tracheo-bronchial wall, and can create bronchoesophageal or bronchoarterial fistulas that may produce fatal hemorrhage. PNBA is characterized by extensive formation of whitish pseudomembranes composed of hyphae, fibrin and necrotic debris. Rather than three distinct entities, these morphologic variants may just represent different stages in the development of IATB.
 Huang et al(2) classifed iIATB into four different forms according to the bronchoscopic features of intraluminal lesions: superficial infiltration type(Type I), full-layer involvement type (Type II), occlusion type (Type III) and mixed type (Type IV). Type IV was the largest group in this study, followed by Type III. All patients with iIATB of Type IV had definite airway occlusion.
 The clinical mainfestations of IATB are entirely different from those of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The insidious presentation with non-specific symptoms and the paucity of findings in chest roentgenograms often delay the diagnosis, giving this disease an ominous prognosis. Airway-related symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, wheezing and hemoptysis are cardinal features. 
The diagnosis of IATB is almost always confirmed by bronchoscopic examination and sampling. 
 In conclusion, IATB is a rare form of invasive aspergillosis affecting mainly immunocompromised patients. The non-specific clinical presentation often leads to late diagnosis and poor prognosis.

","Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a leading infection in immunocompromised patients. Abnormal chest radiographs have been reported in up to 90% of patients with suspected PCP showing the typical findings of diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates most marked in a perihilar distribution. CT is the imaging modality of choice to evaluate those symptomatic patients with a clinical suspicion for PCP but with an otherwise normal or equivocal chest radiograph. CT scanning may demonstrate typical features including perihilar ground-glass opacity, often in a patchy or geographical distribution, with areas of affected lung interspersed by normal lung parenchyma. In addition to the ground glass pattern, there is often associated thickening of the interlobular septa. Although these CT findings are not specific for PCP, together with knowledge of the CD4 count, allow a presumptive diagnosis to be made and early treatment to be instituted before microbiological confirmation becomes available. The radiographic features of PCP in patients with AIDS have been described extensively, with the dominant radiological pattern being areas of ground-glass attenuation with a background of interlobular septal thickening. Little data exist about the pattern of the disease in immunocompromised patients without AIDS. PCP in the immunocompromised patients without AIDS manifests as a more rapid illness with a significantly shorter duration of symptoms from onset to diagnosis. The corresponding predominant radiologic features are widespread ground-glass opacities representing alveolitis in patients without AIDS and the formation of cystic lesions in AIDS patients who had a significantly longer duration of illness before achieving the diagnosis of PCP.

A chemo-port catheter was placed through the left subclavian vein (figure 1). On the present radiograph (figure 2 and 3), the catheter shows the ‘pinch-off sign’, which represents focal luminal narrowing at the proximal portion while passing beneath the clavicle (figure 3). On follow-up chest radiography one month later (figure 4), the catheter was transected and the fragment of catheter located in the right side of the heart (arrows). The distal part of the catheter was retrieved by using snare technique via the right femoral vein (not shown here). The proximal part of the catheter was removed without effort.","Catheter fracture/embolization is a rare (0.1–2.8%) complication of subclavian venous catheters with a long indwelling time. According to the literature, chronic and intermittent mechanical compression of the catheter between the clavicle and the first rib (pinch-off syndrome) is a frequent cause of catheter trauma. In the retrospective analysis of Ouaklnine-Orlando et al, chronic compression of the catheter between the clavicle and the first rib was found in 42.8% of cases with catheter rupture. Regarding other study of 41 patients with chemo-port catheter, pinch-off syndrome was retrospectively seen in 75.6% of the cases of catheter fracture and embolism. 
Early warning symptoms of catheter compression and fracture are intermittent resistance and variable reaction to drug injection, chest wall swelling at the insertion site, and premature ventricular contractions in case of embolization to the heart. The complications include arrhythmia, endocarditis, perforation of the heart and pulmonary embolism. The problem is that many patients are asymptomatic, probably because the usual sites of fragment migration are the right ventricle and pulmonary artery, which have few sensory nerve endings.
This pinch-off sign can be recognized on chest radiograph by observing luminal narrowing as the catheter passes through the costoclavicular space. Prompt removal of the catheter should be needed to avoid catheter fracture/embolization. It is important to recognize this ‘pinch-off sign’, which means impending catheter fracture on chest radiograph.

It is usually associated with various conditions, including HIV or EBV infection, Sj�ren's syndrome, pernicious anemia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Especially, 25% of all LIP cares are associated with Sj�ren's disease. 
Reflecting diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, HRCT usually reveals thickening of perilymphatic interstitium, ground-glass opacity, and poorly defined centrilobular nodules. Furthermore, multiple variable sized thin-walled cystic airspaces are common finding, and should be good differential point from other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. Other findings include lymphnode enlargement (in about 50% of cases) and bronchiectasis.
Definite diagnosis can be made with lung biopsy. Although there is no standard treatment for LIP, steroid therapy is commonly used and other immunosuppressive drugs may be combined. 
Prognosis is variable, and can be grave. Therefore, keen radiologic suspicion and early diagnosis is crucial.

On enhanced CT scan, the nodule reveals homogenous dense enhancement (87HU).","Sclerosing hemangioma is a rare benign tumor, characterized microscopically by four major histologic components: solid, papillary, sclerotic, and hemngiomatous in varying proportions. There is a female-to-male predominance of approximately 4 to 5:1, a gender difference that may be related to the presence of estrogen receptors in some tumors. Most lesions are discovered in patients between 30 and 50 years of age. Most cases were asymptomatic, but some presented with hemoptysis, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and pleurisy. The lesions range from 0.8 to 8.2 cm in diameter, but most are less than 3.5 cm in diameter. They are usually well-defined, circumscribed, hemorrhagic nodules. The tumor is often subpleural, and a thin fibrous pseudocapsule separates it from the adjacent compressed lung parenchyma. On CT, sclerosing hemangioma appeared as well defined juxtapleural masses in all cases. The tumors enhanced by visual criteria in all but one patient with the smallest mass. The CT density of the enhancing mass ranged from 96 to 157 HU. Some patients had calcifications and a few had well defined areas of low attenuation, corresponding with angiomatous, solid and sclerotic, and cystic areas, retrospectively. MRI findings were also reported: they had mixed areas of high and low signal intensity on both T1- and T2- weighted images and were totally enhanced on postcontrast enhanced T1-weighted images. The T1 high signal intensity areas corresponded to those including abundant clear cells, and the T2-weighted low signal intensity areas corresponded to the fibrotic or hemorrhagic areas in the tumors.
The experience using FDG-PET scan in sclerosing hemangioma is limited, and only slightly elevated uptake with an SUV of 1.8 has been recorded. In contrast, in two patients examined by Hsu et al.

In addition, consolidations and numerous centrilobular nodules are also noted in both lung fields. Enlarged lymph nodes are seen in bilateral hilar and subcarinal areas.

","Adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic type of lung cancer. Recent new adenocarcinoma classification provides uniform terminology and diagnostic criteria, especially for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC). The terms BAC and mixed subtype adenocarcinoma are no longer used. For resection specimens, new concepts are introduced such as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) for small solitary adenocarcinomas with either pure lepidic growth (AIS) or predominant lepidic growth with less than 5 mm invasion (MIA). AIS and MIA are usually nonmucinous but rarely may be mucinous. Invasive adenocarcinomas are classified by predominant pattern after using comprehensive histologic subtyping with lepidic (formerly most mixed subtype tumors with nonmucinous BAC), acinar, papillary, and solid patterns; micropapillary is added as a new histologic subtype. Variants include invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (formerly mucinous BAC), colloid, fetal, and enteric adenocarcinoma.

Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, formerly called mucinous BAC, characteristically presents in imaging studies as a range of nodules to lobar replacement by a spectrum of patterns including GGO, mixed GGO/solid foci, or consolidation, but intraalveolar mucus may make the CT appearance solid or nearly solid. The mucoid component may appear as homogeneous consolidation with soft-tissue attenuation that is lower than that of muscle. After administration of an intravenous iodinated contrast agent, vessels are well shown traversing these regions (CT angiogram sign). Overlap does occur between imaging features of mucinous and nonmucinous
invasive adenocarcinomas. SUV for adenocarcinoma of the lung tends to be lower than for other histologic types of lung cancer. For mucinous versus nonmucinous adenocarcinoma, after adjusting for size of the lesion, no significant difference in SUV has been found.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-829-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-829-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-829-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-829-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-829-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-829-6.jpg']",91,"['correct:7/91', 'diff:21/91', 'semi:9/91']"

","Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause that is characterized by the formation of noncaseous epithelioid cell granulomas. Sarcoidosis primarily affects the lung and lymphatic systems.Sarcoidosis involves the respiratory system in > 90% of cases, usually the hilar and mediastinal nodes, and, less frequently, the lung tissue. Airway involvement, as judged by clinical features, physiologic testing, imaging techniques, bronchoscopy, and airway mucosal biopsy, has been observed in nearly two-thirds of patients with sarcoidosis.The initial morphologic abnormality is the airway inflammation manifested by mucosal edema, erythema, and the formation of granulomas. As the airway disease progresses, the mucosa may demonstrate granularity, nodularity, cobblestoning, and friability. Sarcoid nodules in the bronchi may cause postobstructive atelectasis, airway luminal narrowing, and distortion. As the fibrotic phase sets in, mucosal thinning, pallor, and scarring may lead to airway luminal narrowing and stenosis. CT scans may demonstrate bronchial distortion, angulation, and displacement. Decreased airway luminal diameter caused by endobronchial granulomas and evidence of bronchial mural thickening may be seen. Extrinsic compression of the airways by the enlarged lymph nodes may be depicted. However, CT scans can be misleading and provide false-positive results, incorrectly predicting the presence of focal bronchial abnormalities in up to 15% of patients.The main role of chest CT scanning is to evaluate the thoracic lymph nodes and pulmonary parenchymal process.

The recorded symptoms and sequelae include chest pain, shortness of breath, leg swelling (edema), hypotension, arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and severe respiratory distress.

There is no calcification, cystic change or necrosis within the mass. On MRI, the mass show iso-signal intensity compared to skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images, high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and intense enhancement on contrast- enhanced T1-weighted images. Mass excision operation was performed. About 5cm sized, oval shaped mass was noted at the right posterior mediastinum, and pathologically confirmed as a Castleman disease, hyaline-vascular type.","Castleman disease is a rare cause of massive lymph node enlargement. Although intrathoracic lymph nodes are most commonly affected, nodes at any location can be involved. The hyaline vascular type is the most common (90%) and show a follicular structure with tumor nodules composed predominantly with small lymphocytes and a large number of blood vessels in the interfollicular space. The plasma cell type (10%) shows sheets of interfollicular cells and fewer blood vessels. Castleman disease of either type may occur at any age, but it most frequently affects young adults.
On noncontrast-enhanced CT, the mass is usually homogeneous and of soft tissue attenuation. Calcification is uncommon (5-10%) and, when it occurs, calcification is typically coarse central in location. Imaging studies one of three morphologic pattern: (1) solitary mass (50%); (2) dominant infiltrative mass with associated lymphadenopathy (40%); and (3) diffuse lymphadenopathy confined to a single mediastinal compartment (10%). Hyaline vascular Castleman disease usually enhances intensely following administration of contrast material, but plasma cell Castleman disease shows a less enhancement. The lesions are typically heterogeneous and have increased signal intensity compared to skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images. They become hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and low signal septa are occasionally visible within the lesion. Because the lesions are hypervascular, diffuse enhancement following administration of contrast media is common.

",Benign Bronchoesophageal Fistula (associated with chronic pneumonia),"Chest radiograph shows a bulging opacity in the left lower lobe obliterating the descending aortic margin. CT shows a segmental consolidation in the left lower lobe abutting the esophagus and the thoracic aorta. In the area of consolidation, a tubular low density of fluid-filled bronchus looks extending into the esophageal lumen. Below the level of this connection, there is a small radiopaque spot in the consolidation area with marked luminal dilatation of the esophagus. Neither esophageal mass nor other mediastinal disease was defined on the CT images. Following the impression of broncho-esophageal fistula (BEF) on the CT, large BEF tract was noted on the endoscopy (A) and a communication between the lower esophagus and the posterobasal segmental bronchus was demonstrated on the esophagogram (B). Without any evidence of fibrosis, inflammation or lympahdenopathy around the esophagus, a congenital fistula or foreign body erosion could be considered in this case.","Different from the common events of malignant BEF, benign BEFs are rare and about 120 cases have been reported in the English literature. They can be congenital or acquired. Acquired BEFs were more frequently reported than congenital types and induced by traumatic, inflammatory (tuberculosis, histoplasmosis), or iatrogenic origin (including foreign body). 
Compared to tracheo-esophageal fistulas, which has pronounced symptoms, benign BEF presents with rather inconspicuous and insidious symptoms such as chronic cough or asthma not responding to treatment. Those nonspecific symptoms may delay a correct diagnosis (as was the case in our patient).
A wide array of diagnostic tools is applicable in the diagnosis of BEF. Plain radiography and CT scan of chest can give information of the lungs and the mediastinum, but they may not confirm the clinical suspicion. Endoscopic examinations of bronchi and esophagus may fail to identify the anomalous orifice but may reveal inflammatory changes and exclude a malignancy. Esophagography with dilute barium is almost always decisive in the diagnosis of BEF even if sometimes, despite thorough investigation, the diagnosis is made only at surgery. In this case, CT gave a very helpful information, and esophagoscopy and esophagogram confirmed the diagnosis of BEF.
Once diagnosed, benign BEFs require immediate surgical treatment because of the risk of chronic sepsis, wider tissue destruction requiring additional surgery or fatal massive hemoptysis.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-841-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-841-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-841-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-841-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-841-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-841-6.jpg']",112,"['correct:39/112', 'diff:18/112', 'semi:1/112']"

Erdheim-Chester disease is characterized by tissue infiltration by foamy histiocytes (xanthogranulomatosis) with immunohistochemical characteristics different from those of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
Erdheim-Chester disease is characterized by heterogeneous systemic manifestations. Bone pain is the most frequent symptom. Bone involvement consists of symmetric osteosclerosis of the long tubular bones, predominating in the metaphysic and diaphysis of the lower limbs. About half of all patients have extraskeletal manifestations including exophthalmos, diabetes insipidus, xanthelasma, interstitial lung disease, bilateral adrenal enlargement, retroperitoneal fibrosis with perirenal and/or ureteral obstruction, renal impairment, testis infiltration, central nervous system, and/or cardiovascular involvement.
Symmetric and bilateral peri- and pararenal soft-tissue infiltration (hairy kidney) extending to the adrenal glands and renal pedicles or circumferential periaortic infiltration from the aortic arch to the primary iliac artery origin (coated aorta) or both are suggestive of Erdheim-Chester disease. The periaortic infiltration may extend to the ascending aorta, coronary arteries, and aortic branches, with risk of vascular stenosis.

And also there are multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, both hilum, axillary areas, and upper abdomen.
The histopathological diagnosis of pulmonary involvement of Castleman's disease (plasma cell type) with interstitial infiltration of plasma cells was made by transbronchial lung biopsy of the right middle lobe.
","Castleman disease (CD) is an uncommon benign lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles. On the basis of histologic criteria, it has been divided into two types: hyaline vascular and plasma cell. From a clinical standpoint, CD is also classified as localized or multicentric.
The hyaline vascular type accounts for approximately 90% of cases and usually manifests as a solitary perihilar or mediastinal mass in asymptomatic patients. The plasma cell types are often associated with multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), with generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Clinically, MCD occurs in older population than localized CD, with most patients being in their fifth and sixth decade. It often results in various systemic manifestations, such as fever, anemia, and infections and malignancies such as lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma. The frequency of MCD associated with a lung lesion is relatively low (10-20%) in the United States. In contrast, Nishimoto et al. reported that 18 of 28 Japanese cases (=64.3%) had a lung lesion. 
The CT findings of intrathoracic involvement in MCD include bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, centrilobular nodular opacities, thin-walled cysts, interlobular septal thickening, thickening of bronchovascular bundles, and ground-glass attenuation. Some reports have noted that the lung lesion in MCD is compatible with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP). The enlarged lymph nodes seen in the multicentric form of Castleman disease have histologic findings predominantly of the plasma cell type, with only a small amount of capillary proliferation. This presumably accounts for the relatively low level of enhancement after the intravenous administration of contrast material. MCD is difficult to treat and usually progressive, even with the use of steroids and chemotherapeutic agent. Multicentric CD had a much worse prognosis than localized CD and currently regarded as a potentially malignant lymphoproliferative disorder.

We can see the enlarged mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes.,"Sarcoidosis is a multi-system disease of unknown etiology, usually affecting the respiratory tract and other organs, and is characterized by the formation of nonnecrotizing epithelioid granulomas. The diagnosis depends on a combination of a typical clinicoradiological presentation, the finding of nonnecrotizing epithelioid granulomas in a tissue biopsy, and exclusion of other possible diseases, especially those of infectious etiology. The granulomas are present in a lymphatic pattern around bronchovascular structures and, because of this, may show angioinvasion. The bronchial involvement produces a high diagnostic yield for transbronchial and endobronchial biopsies in this disease. Finally, small amounts of fibrinoid necrosis may occur within granulomas of sarcoidosis and do not exclude the diagnosis. (1).
Sarcoidosis results from an uncontrolled cell-mediated immune reaction (2). Interactions between chemokines and receptors that activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways play a major role in inflammation and T-cell responses (3). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-[alpha] is an important player in granuloma formation, and recent clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of TNF-[alpha] inhibitors in sarcoidosis. Paradoxically, there are several case reports in the medical literature describing the development of sarcoidosis in patients treated with TNF-[alpha] inhibitors(4).

Predisposing factors such as structural abnormalities of the pharynx, esophageal disorders (achalasia, Zenker diverticulum, hiatus hernia, and reflux), neurologic defects, and chronic illness are common. However, in many cases, no predisposing condition is found.
Symptoms include cough, mild fever, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort.
Chest radiographs are usually nonspecific, demonstrating bilateral lower-lobe air-space opacities, mixed alveolar and interstitial opacities, and occasionally poorly marginated focal mass-like lesions that mimic pulmonary neoplasms. If a large amount of lipid has been aspirated, high-resolution CT usually reveals consolidation that is characteristically low in attenuation (-35 to -75 HU), indicating the presence of lipid deposition. However, exogenous lipoid pneumonia can also manifest as geographic ground-glass attenuation; this appearance is most common in patients with chronic mineral oil aspiration. An appearance of ground-glass opacity associated with interlobular septal thickening and intralobular lines (crazy paving) has also been reported. This crazy-paving pattern reflects intraalveolar and interstitial accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes in the alveolar lining. Centrilobular opacities may also be seen. However, because inflammation or fibrosis may accompany the presence of the lipid material, the CT attenuation of the consolidation need not be low. In some patients, necrosis and cavitation may be present. Diagnosis can be difficult, since many patients do not recall a history of ingestion or inhalation of mineral oil substances. Bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsy, or open lung biopsy combined with a history of oil ingestion and radiographic studies are usually diagnostic.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-845-1.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-845-2.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-845-3.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-845-4.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-845-5.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-845-6.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-845-7.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-845-8.JPG']",121,"['correct:45/121', 'diff:26/121']"

Thymomas represent 20% of all mediastinal neoplasms in adults; they are the most common anterior mediastinal primary neoplasm in adults. The peak prevalence of thymoma is during the fifth and sixth decades of life. Thymomas have no sex predilection. About one-half of thymomas are found in the upper and middle thirds of the mediastinum, and the remainder are found in the lower third. Patients with thymoma are frequently asymptomatic; however, 20%-30% of patients have pressure-induced symptoms such as cough, chest pain, dyspnea, dysphagia, hoarseness, or superior vena cava syndrome. One-third to one-half of thymoma patients develops myasthenia gravis. Patients with thymoma may also develop pure red blood cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia, connective tissue disease, autoimmune disease, or inflammatory bowel disease.

At radiography, thymomas typically appear as sharply marginated retrosternal areas of increased opacity with smooth or lobulated borders. Thymomas may project to either side of the mediastinum and obscure the heart border.

On CT scans, thymomas usually appear as homogeneous solid masses with soft-tissue attenuation and well-demarcated borders. Thymomas may be oval, round, or lobulated and usually do not conform to the shape of the thymus. Large thymomas may show areas of cystic or necrotic degeneration. Calcification may be present in the capsule or throughout the mass. Well-defined fat planes between the thymoma and adjacent structures generally indicate absence of extensive local invasion. Certain findings, such as encasement of mediastinal structures, infiltration of fat planes, and an irregular interface between the mass and lung parenchyma, are highly suggestive of invasion. Pleural thickening, nodularity, or effusion generally indicates pleural invasion by the thymoma.

At MR imaging, thymomas commonly appear as homogeneous or heterogeneous masses with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. MR imaging can be used to help identify vascular invasion. Chemical shift MR imaging, which makes use of the difference in chemical shift ratio, can be valuable in differentiating thymic hyperplasia from thymomas and other thymic tumors.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-848-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-848-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-848-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-848-4.jpg']",111,"['correct:39/111', 'diff:33/111', 'semi:12/111']"

Follow up chest PA after 45 months shows slightly progressed mediastinal widening. CT scan (mediastinal window) shows a fatty lesion with mass effect on superior vena cava and on the aortic arch. There is also increased volume of the mass at the same level of follow up chest CT. The mass composes largely of fatty tissue and some fine nodules and minimal streaky soft tissue portion. ,"Primary mediastinal liposarcomas are rare tumors that arise in the anterior and posterior mediastinum with relatively equal frequency. Less than 5% of liposarcomas arise in the mediastinum. Similar to primary retroperitoneal liposarcomas, mediastinal liposarcomas are most common in adults and are most often well differentiated. 
 The predominant finding of mediastinal liposarcoma on conventional chest radiography is a widened mediastinum. Deviation of the trachea and vessels may be apparent. On CT and MR imaging, mediastinal liposarcomas appear as inhomogeneous fatty masses that vary in appearance depending on the amount of soft tissue and fibrous bands in the tumor. 
 Well-differentiated liposarcomas or atypical lipomas are low-grade lesions containing a large amount of fat, usually more than 75%of their volume. They are difficult to confidently differentiate from benign lipomas. Fibrous septa may be broader and more nodular than those seen in lipomas. These tumors often recur if only marginally excised but do not metastasize. 
 Currently, the overall distribution of liposarcoma arising at all sites is 45% to 50% well-differentiated liposarcomas, 30% to 35% myxoid liposarcomas, 15% to 20% dedifferentiated liposarcomas, and 5% are pleomorphic liposarcomas. Overall, prognosis correlates with tumor subtype, as rapid tumor recurrence and metastatic disease were more common in patients with dedifferentiated and pleomorphic subtypes, whereas patients with well-differentiated tumors rarely recur or metastasize.

","Solitary fibrous tumors are rare primary pleural neoplasms that may grow to large sizes and typically affect symptomatic men and women over the age of 40 years.
Small solitary fibrous tumor of pleura without gross necrosis, hemorrhage, or cystic change may exhibit homogeneous attenuation on unenhanced and less frequently on contrast-enhanced chest CT scans. However, the majority of solitary fibrous tumor of pleura exhibit heterogeneous attenuation on CT scans, characterized as intralesional geographic, focal or linear areas of low attenuation that often correlate with hemorrhage, necrosis, or cystic changes. Calcification may occur in one-fourth of cases. Atelectasis of the adjacent lung and mass effect on the mediastinum are common associated findings.
Enhancement may correlate with the vascular nature of these lesions and may result in higher attenuation than that of other soft tissues in the thorax. Lee and colleagues studied nine cases of LFTP with CT and demonstrated significant enhancement in all. Enhancement is typically heterogeneous (particularly in large lesions) with central areas of low attenuation, which have been shown to correlate with myxoid change, hemorrhage, necrosis, or cystic degeneration.

On initial chest radiograph performed at other hospital (Fig. 7), double contour of increased opacity is noted in the right retrocardiac area, suggesting a mass lesion. After 15 months, follow-up chest radiograph performed at our hospital (Fig.8) shows homogenous increased opacity in right middle and lower lung zones. ","Pulmonary hamartomas are considered to be true mesenchymal tumors. They account for approximately 8% of all pulmonary tumors (1) and 75% of all benign pulmonary tumors. There are the two types of pulmonary hamartoma: parenchymal tumor and endobronchial tumor.
  Endobronchial hamartomas are relatively rare, accounting for 1-20% of all pulmonary hamartomas, and are more likely to cause symptoms related to airway obstruction than other hamartomas (2). Most hamartomas are located in peripheral areas; they may be asymptomatic, and their growth is generally slow (approximately 3 mm per year) (3). The underlying cause of a hamartoma is unclear, although chronic inflammatory irritants are a possible etiological factor (4). 
In our present case, at surgery, the mass lesion proved to develop from the mediastinal aspect of the right visceral pleura, made right inferior pulmonary ligament stretched, and located in the pleural cavity. The mass did not invade the parietal pleura and diaphragm. At the medial aspect of the tumor, mild adhesion with esophageal muscle layer was noted, probably due to mass effect of the tumor. On pathologic findings, the tumor was composed of mature cartilage, smooth muscle and adipose tissue and had no malignant cells. 
Like a present case, the pleural origin seem to be rare that only four cases have been reported (5,6,7,8). They seem to be developing from the hilar, mediastinal, interlobar region of visceral pleura. The unusual growth pattern may be caused by ectopic bronchial tissue underneath the visceral pleura, developing toward the pleural cavity (8). 
  Treatment is usually conservative with regular chest roentgenograms during the follow-up. However, when malignancy cannot be ruled out by this procedure or when the nodules are rapidly growing, surgery should be considered.

Of these, at least cobalt is toxic to the lung. Exposure to aerosolized particulates containing cobalt inhaled during the manufacture or grinding of hard metal results in interstitial inflammation with fibrosis and lung destruction, which may develop within a few years of exposure. The histologic appearance of hard metal pneumoconiosis has been termed giant cell interstitial pneumonia.
The clinical features of GIP are nonspecific. Patients complain of shortness of breath, cough and dyspnea on exertion. Generally, if exposure is avoided, patients improved in symptoms and physiologic study, although residual lesions tend to persist.
HRCT findings include ground-glass opacity, coarse reticular opacities, consolidation, architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis, and subpleural bullae. The presence of ground-glass opacity and reticulation are most common, but honeycombing may occur with disease progression. These CT findings correspond histopathologically to areas of interstitial thickening caused by fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration and to areas of intra-alveolar accumulation of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. The distribution may be patchy or with upper or lower lobe predominance.
The histopathologic manifestations of hard-metal disease range from bronchitis to subacute fibrosing alveolitis to interstitial fibrosis. Obliterative bronchiolitis is reported to be the earliest manifestation of hard-metal disease. Subacute fibrosing alveolitis is characterized by the desquamation of epithelial cells and the accumulation of macrophages and multinuclear giant cells in the alveolar spaces within a few years of initial exposure, whereas chronic diffuse mural fibrosis with honeycombing occurs several years or more after initial exposure.

The typical absence of both a dominant pulmonary tumor and an extrapulmonary primary tumor suggest that the tumor originates in a multifocal fashion within the lung. Some authors, however, have reported evidence for a primary extrapulmonary origin. The usual pathologic manifestations consist of multiple well-demarcated parenchymal nodules ranging in diameter from 0.3 to 3.0 cm. Light microscopic appearances are characteristic. A hypocellular sclerotic central portion is surrounded by a somewhat more cellular periphery. Dystrophic calcification and ossification may occur in the acellular region, although it is only occasionally recognizable radiographically.

The patient was confirmed with ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis, named Wegener granulomatosis in the past, by RLL lobectomy; pathologic findings are parenchymal necrosis, vasculitis, organizing pneumonia, and granulomatous inflammation.
","ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis (AGV) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that usually involves upper airway disease (almost always involvement; nasal, oral, or sinus inflammation from chronic sinusitis to septal perforation), lower respiratory airway disease (90%; lung), kidney (80%; from segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis to rarely RCC) and other less common organs including skin-purpura, PNS-sensory neuropathy and cardiac involvement. Lung biopsy of AGV shows a granulomatous small-vessel necrotizing vasculitis. AGV most commonly occurs in whites and affects men and women equally and the mean age is 40 years. Elevation of serum cytoplasmic antineutrophil antibodies against protease 3 in cytoplasmic granules(c-ANCA) is positive more than 90% of patients with active stage of AGV. Patients with AGV have respiratory symptom such as hemoptysis, cough and dyspnea.
CT is sensitive for detection of lung involvement. Lung nodules and masses are the most common manifestation of AGV (40~70%) presenting multiply, bilaterally and without a zonal predilection and usually measuring between 2 and 4cm. The CT halo sign (a rim of GGO surrounding a nodule) is seen in 15% and most noncavitated nodules or masses show central low attenuation reflecting extensive central necrosis. The nodules may occur in a centrilobular distribution. Cavitation with thin or thick wall occurs in 25% of nodules larger than 2 cm. Approximately 50% of the nodules and masses resolve responding to treatment, 40% decrease in size and 10% remain unchanged. Air-fluid level in cavity is more suggestive of pulmonary infection rather than primary cavity of AGV.
Airspace consolidation and ground-glass opacity (20-50%) may result from alveolar hemorrhage or pneumonitis. They may have a random distribution, a peribronchial distribution, or appear as peripheral wedge-shaped lesions mimicking pulmonary infarction.
Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage occurs in 10% of patients with AGV, airway involvement in 15-25% as form of subglottic tracheal and/or bronchial stenosis in the central airways. 
Although pathogenesis is unclear, the immunosuppression with corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide is the best current therapy (remission rate; 87%). In April 2011, the FDA approved rituximab (a chimeric antibody to CD20 protein) in combination with steroids to treat patients with AGV, but relapse is still common.

Primary endobronchial leiomyosarcoma is an uncommon malignancy of the lung. Leiomyosarcoma is somewhat more common than leiomyoma and is more common in men than women with a ratio of 2.5 to 1. Leiomyosarcomas are thought to arise from smooth muscles tissues in bronchus and pulmonary vascular structures. Endobronchial leiomyosarcomas are often symptomatic, complaining cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis or chest pain. Unlike other carcinoma of the lung, leiomyosarcoma is not associated with cigarette smoking or other potential inhalant carcinogens.
Radiographic findings consists of sharply defined lobulated pulmonary mass or atelectasis due to bronchial obstruction. Endobronchial mass may be observed on CT scans but definitive diagnosis can only be made by excision biopsy. 
Prognosis is not well known because of the rarity of this neoplasm. According to reports, children and adolescents show more favorable prognosis than adults. Some reports describe that endobronchial tumors are less aggressive than parenchymal neoplasm, largely because the former tend to be smaller and diagnosed earlier.

The tumor extended to left 6th intercostal space and it was free from adjacent ribs. The tumor was easy to break, and included friable calcifications on the inside.
Photomicrograph of resected mass with H and E stain shows malignant spindle cell sarcoma with osteoid deposition and bone formation by pleomorphic tumor cells. 
Extraskeletal osteosarcoma is a malignant mesenchymal soft-tissue neoplasm without attachment to the skeleton, which is able to produce osteoid or cartilaginous matrix. Hitologically, it is indistinguishable from osteogenic osteosarcoma, but, should be considered clinically and therapeutically separate from osteogenic osteosarcoma. 
Extraskeletal osteosarcoma is a rare malignant neoplasm that accounts for approximately 1% of all soft-tissue sarcomas and 4% of osteogenic osteosarcomas. Unlike typical skeletal osteosarcomas, extraskeletal osteosarcoma affects older patients and usually presents in the sixth or the seventh decades.
Extraskeletal osteosarcoma may be asymptomatic or present with an enlarging mass or pain. The primary treatment of extraskeletal osteosarcoma is surgical resection. In addition, some patients are treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Patients with extraskeletal osteosarcoma have a poor prognosis (5yrs survival rate < 40%), and more than half of the patients develop recurrences and metastases.
On radiographs, extraskeletal osteosarcoma often appears as soft-tissue opacity with variable amounts of mineralization (focal or extensive).
On CT, the tumor is separate from adjacent osseous structures and appears to have a pseudocapsule. Matrix mineralization is best appreciated on CT. On contrast-enhanced images, the tumor shows heteregeneous enhancement depending on the degree of necrosis.
On MRI, the tumor is usually a relatively well-circumscribed heterogeneous mass, which is isointense relative to skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images and isointense to mildly hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Hemorrage is not rare and may be represented by hyperintense foci on T1- and T2-weighted images.

However, there is sparing of the posterior membranous portion of the trachea, where cartilage is not present. Additionally, cricoids cartilage show similar findings with multifocal calcification. On coronal scan, marked calcification involving the bilateral costal cartilages is noted. 
The diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis was made based on the patient’s clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. Methotrexate and corticosteroid therapy were performed.
","Relapsing polychondritis is a rare, autoimmune syndrome characterized by recurrent episodes of cartilaginous inflammation with subsequent degeneration, loss of structure, and fibrosis. It commonly involves cartilaginous structures of the external ear, nose, peripheral joints, larynx, and tracheobronchial tree. Peak prevalence occurs between 40 and 60 years of age, and there is no reported gender preference.  Auricular chondritis is the most common initial presentation. Although respiratory manifestation is reported to be about 20% initially, up to 50% eventually present with air-way symptoms with disease progression. Airway involvement is associated with poor prognosis and is leading cause of death in affected patients. 

At radiography, diffuse or localized airway involvement may be seen. The larynx and upper trachea are affected most frequently, but the disease may involve airways to the subsegmental level. Progressive cartilage calcification and destruction of integrity is commonly reported imaging feature of relapsing polychondritis. Airway wall also show increased thickness, seen in about 80% of patients. Wall thickening are typically smooth and diffuse. Fixed airway narrowing and/or obstruction can be seen in some cases. One most important imaging finding to remember is that above findings spare to posterior membranous portion of the airway, because there is normally no cartilaginous tissue present. When costal cartilages are involved, similar finding of cartilage destruction with progressive calcification can be noted on simple radiograph or CT images. 

No single medical or surgical treatment is uniformly effective in curing the disease, relieving the symptoms, or preventing progression of airway manifestations. The mainstray of treatment remains medical management with corticosteroids.

On CT and MR images, both myxoid and mesenchymal chondrosarcomas have features similar to those described for tumors of these histologic types located in bone. Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, reflective of its extremely high water content, appears with low attenuation on CT scans and very high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images, with only mild peripheral to septal enhancement after contrast material administration. Extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, which has lower water content caused by the intermixture of small cells and more limited cartilaginous tissue, has attenuation similar to that of muscle on CT scans and typically has intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images.

Once the parasite passes through the intestinal wall to reach the portal venous system or lymphatic system, the liver acts as the first line of defense and is therefore the most frequently involved organ. Hydatid disease primarily affects the liver and typically demonstrates characteristic imaging findings. However, there are many potential local complications (eg, intrahepatic complications, exophytic growth, transdiaphragmatic thoracic involvement, perforation into hollow viscera, peritoneal seeding, biliary communication, portal vein involvement, abdominal wall invasion). 
In humans, hydatid disease involves the liver in approximately 75% of cases, the lung in 15%, and other anatomic locations in 10%. Intrathoracic extrapulmonary hydatid disease constitutes 2.3% - 7.4% of all hydatid diseases. Among intrathoracic extrapulmonary hydatid cysts, 55% of the cysts are located in the fissure, 18% within the parietal pleura, 14% in the chest wall, 4.5% in the mediastinum, and 4.5% in the diaphragm.

It is frequently accompanied by thin-walled cavitary pulmonary metastasis and is often obscured on chest radiograph. Imperfect vessel-like structures of the cavitary metastasis in this disease are likely to break down and finally grow up to large thin-walled cavities. The Secondary pneumothorax is also known as a characteristic complication in this disease due to lung metastasis. A study reported that secondary pneumothorax was observed in 10 of 17 patients with scalp angiosarcoma. Characteristic findings on chest CT were multiple thin-wall cavities and ground-glass attenuation around the cavity, located in bilateral subpleural lung fields. It is suggested that the subpleural thin-wall cavities cause pneumothorax. Secondary pneumothorax caused by this disease was intractable, resulting in an unfavorable outcome. It is necessary to develop a proper treatment strategy for secondary pneumothorax to create a favorable prognosis in this disease. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is rarely the presenting manifestation of angiosarcoma. The finding of alveolar hemorrhage without identifiable tumor was considered supportive of a nonneoplastic DAH syndrome but subsequently some of these patients are discovered to have metastatic angiosarcoma.

Recent new adenocarcinoma classification provides uniform terminology and diagnostic criteria, especially for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC). According to new classification, variants include invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (formerly mucinous BAC), colloid, fetal, and enteric adenocarcinoma. 
 Mucinous adenocarcinoma and lymphoma are malignant neoplasms that may present as chronic consolidations. Lymphangitis carcinomatosa and metastasis are rare causes of the entity. Mucinous adenocarcinoma tumors grow along the alveolar wall without destroying the underlying architecture, so-called lepidic growth, combined with copious secretion of mucin, which results in consolidations.
 Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, formerly called mucinous BAC, is characteristically seen as nodule or air-space consolidations. This may accompany ground-glass opacity.

",Metastasis from thyroid cancer.,"Right thyroid lobectomy state is seen on CT (Figure 1). The prevascular LN is enlarged and heterogeneously enhanced (Figure 2). A lobular and elongate mass is involving both the lung parenchyma and right bronchus intermedius, which protrudes into bronchial lumen. In the collapsed right middle lobe, fluid-filled and dilated bronchi are seen (Figure 3-4).
","Endobronchial metastases from nonpulmonary tumors are uncommon. The frequences of endobronchial metastasis are variable by definition, ranging from 2-50% of pulmonary metastases from extrathoracic neoplasm. One definition includes only direct metastasis to the tracheobronchial wall, and the other includes the secondary involvement as well as direct invasion.
A variety of tumors, breast, colorectal, renal, ovarian, thyroid, uterine, testicular, nasopharynx, prostate, and adrenal carcinomas; sarcomas; melanomas; and plasmacytomas has been associated with endorbonchial metastasis, although breast, colorectal, renal carcinomas predominate.

Patients histologically diagnosed as having endobronchial metastases were retrospectively evaluated and it was found that endobronchial metastases can be asymptomatic and diagnosed simultaneously, and that upper lobe involvement and lymphocytic inflammation predominate (1).
The metastases may occur directly onto the bronchial wall, or may occur initially in the lymph nodes or lung parenchyma around the bronchus and then invade through the bronchial wall.
The former occurrence is less frequent. Kiryu et al . (2) described four types of developmental modes for EBM: type I, direct metastases to the bronchus; type 2, bronchial invasion by a parenchymal lesion; type 3, bronchial invasion by mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes; and type 4, peripheral lesions extending along the proximal bronchus. Both direct (27.7%) and indirect involvement of bronchus were detected.

It is important to make a distinction between EBM and primary lung cancers and benign lesions, as treatment approaches will differ. An exact histological diagnosis needs to be established in each patient.

Some cases of endobronchial metastases from papillary or follicular thyroid cancer manifested with hemoptysis were reported (3, 4).

MALT lymphoma originates most frequently in various extranodal sites, approximately 51% of cases being in the gastrointestinal tract. Predisposing factors are autoimmune disease, chronic helicobacter pylori infection, and smoking. MALT lymphoma tends to remain localized in the affected organ for a prolonged period, being indolent and therefore responding well to therapy. These lymphomas, however, can progress to high-grade large B cell lymphoma. Primary pulmonary lymphoma is an uncommon neoplasm, the prevalence being less than 1%. The commonest radiological manifestations of pulmonary MALT lymphoma were pulmonary masses, or mass-like areas of consolidation and multiple pulmonary nodules. Common associated features included air-bronchogram, a positive angiogram sign on contrast enhanced CT, a halo of ground-glass shadowing or peribronchovascular thickening at tumor margins and discreet patches of ground-glass shadowing. These appearances are similar to the features described in secondary pulmonary lymphoma. In most cases the diagnosis of MALT lymphoma was made on either open or thoracoscopic biopsy, or following surgical resection. Needle biopsy, lavage and bronchial biopsy can provide a diagnosis. Use of PCR analysis and immunohistochemistry may be helpful.

On the left lower lobectomy specimen, a unilocular cyst with an internal yellowish mucoid material was revealed. The final pathological diagnosis was an intrapulmonary bronchogenic cyst with surrounding fibrosis and bronchiolization.","Bronchogenic cyst is a congenital lesion arising from abnormal budding of the embryonic foregut, which occurs between the 26th and 40th days of gestation. The cysts are lined by respiratory epithelium with a wall containing glands, cartilage, and smooth-muscle elements. Most of the cysts are located in the mediastinum along the tracheobronchial tree, but they can also be found in the lung parenchyma or may extend to or below the diaphragm as dumb-bell cysts.
On computed tomography (CT), intrapulmonary bronchogenic cysts appear as a sharply defined, solitary, uncalcified, round or oval density presenting as one of three categories: a cyst with a homogeneous water density, an air-filled cyst, or a cyst containing an air-fluid level. The high attenuation of bronchogenic cysts on unenhanced CT scans is caused by hemorrhage, proteinaceous mucus, calcium, or calcium oxalate.  Unlike mediastinal cysts, communication with bronchial tree or adjacent lung parenchyma is far more frequent in intrapulmonary bronchogenic cysts, leading to frequent recurrent infection. There is generally no controversy surrounding surgical treatment of bronchogenic cysts with repeated infections.

This is a case of localized fibrous tumor of the pleura, located in mediastinum, showing different enhancement features compared with metastasis (or metastatic lymphodenopathy) of underlying HCC patient.
","Localzied fibrous tumor of the pleura (LFTP) is mesenchymal neoplasm, usually discovered incidentally on chest radiographs of asymptomatic patients. LFTPs are lobulated soft-tissue masses, which are often described as pedunculated lesions arising from the visceral pleura. Approximately 70 to 80% of these tumors arise from visceral pleura, with the remainder arising from the parietal pleura. LFTP exist in the costal compartment of pleura, within an interlobar fissure, along pleural surface of mediastinum, along the diaphragmatic pleura and rarely within the lung parenchyma.
CT findings are strictly dependent on tumor size. In case of small SFTP, CT more frequently typically demonstrates a homogeneous well defined, non-invasive, lobular, soft-tissue mass, usually adjacent to the chest wall or within a fissure, showing an obtuse angle with the pleural surface. Large lesion is usually heterogeneous and may not exhibit CT features suggestive of focal pleural tumors. Such lesions usually form acute angles with the adjacent pleural surface mimicking a subpleural pulmonary mass that could be misdiagnosed as peripheral lung cancer or metastasis. Enhancement after contrast medium is typically intense and heterogeneous with central areas of low attenuation. 
Excision is curative in the majority of patients, although a small number of lesions can recur, undergo malignant transformation, or metastasize.

Mediastinal setting of chest CT image shows small amount of bilateral pleural effusion.
","Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) represents a clinical entity that is distinct from other idiopathic eosinophilic lung diseases. Diagnostic criteria include acute severe febrile illness of less than 5 days of duration; hypoxemia; diffuse alveolar or mixed alveolar-interstitial opacities on chest radiographs; BAL fluid consisting of more than 25% eosinophils; absence of parasitic, fungal, or other infection; prompt and complete response to corticosteroids; and no relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroids. Peripheral blood eosinophils percentages are usually normal, although they become elevated during the subsequent clinical course. Unlike with blood eosinophils, a very high percentage of BAL eosinophils is characteristic of AEP. The majority of cases are idiopathic. Occasionally, it may result from drug reaction or inhalation exposure to smoke, particularly cigarette smoke. Tobacco smoke has been shown to be a trigger for acute eosinophilic pneumonia, especially in new-onset smokers. Patients respond rapidly to high doses of corticosteroids, usually within 24 hrs.

Typical radiographic finding is diffuse bilateral reticular opacities with or without patchy consolidation and pleural effusion. On chest CT, it shows findings of bilateral patchy area of ground glass opacity and consolidation accompanied with poorly defined nodules and smooth interlobular septal thickening. Pleural effusion is commonly combined.

The radiologic differential diagnosis for AEP includes hydrostatic pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome or acute interstitial pneumonia, and atypical bacterial or viral pneumonia. However, developing a clinicoradiologic differential diagnosis for AEP is often difficult because initial peripheral blood eosinophil counts are usually normal.

Spindle cell carcinoma of the esophagus is rare (0.5~2.8 % of all esophageal neoplasm). The current understanding of this tumor is that it originates from an epithelial cell with divergent bidirectional differentiation. 
Spindle cell carcinoma usually affects middle-aged men (male-to-female ratio, 4:1 to 9:1). Presenting symptoms are nonspecific; the most common are dysphagia and weight loss, followed by pain. Most spindle cell tumors (more than 90%) arise from the middle and distal esophagus. Most patients present early in the disease process, infrequently invading the esophageal wall, due to its intraluminal location and rapid growth (doubling time, 2.2~5 months). The tumor frequently spreads loco-regionally or metastasizes to the lung and liver (38~50%). 
The surface of spindle cell carcinoma may be smooth, lobulated, or scalloped, and a cupola, or domelike shape, is usually seen at the proximal interface with the esophageal lumen. Focal ulcerations and luminal obstruction are infrequent.
At CT, spindle cell tumor is seen as an expansile, low-attenuation, intraluminal mass, with differentials including fibrovascular polyp, myofibroma, pedunculated lipoma, and leiomyoma (benign) and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, melanoma, oat cell carcinoma, and lymphoma (malignancies).

",Congenital Lobar Emphysema,"Lund and mediastinal window images of axial and coronal chest CT scans show multiple cystic lesions with or without air-fluid level and overdistended parenchyma in the left lower lobe. There are associated mediastinal shift and adjacent compressive atelectasis of normal parenchyma. (Figs1-6)
Chest radiograph shows a hyperlucent left lung, left rib space widening, and left hemidiaphragm depression causing left to right sided mediastinal shift. (Fig 7)
","The term congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) is preferable to the term congenital pulmonary overinflation (CLO) although the term emphysema is technically inaccurate because the alveoli expand and the alveolar walls remain intact. CLE usually affects a single lobe of the lungs and results from progressive lobar overexpansion and subsequent compression of the ipsilateral remaining lung, which can be secondary to an intrinsic cartilaginous abnormality with resultant weak or absent bronchial cartilage or extrinsic compression of an airway. The collapsed airway can act as a one-way valve, resulting in air trapping. Radiography performed during the neonatal period may show a radiodense area in the lung, since the involved section is still filled with fluid. Over time, the fluid will resolve via the lymphatic and capillary systems. After birth, the affected lung will progressively overinflate and become hyperlucent on conventional radiographs as well as CT scans. With continued expansion, there can be associated mediastinal shift, rib space widening, hemidiaphragm depression, and adjacent compressive atelectasis. At imaging, CLE can be confused with a pneumothorax or pulmonary cyst, but the presence of organized pulmonary markings coursing through an overdistended portion of the affected lung should help in making the diagnosis of CLE. At microscopy, CLE have airspace enlargement without maldevelopment whereas congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) have the cysts lined by ciliated or cuboid respiratory epithelium (Fig). In addition, pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) arises from a disruption of the basement membrane of the alveolar wall, allowing air entry into the interstitial space that may be due to aspiration of foreign material or partial occlusion of bronchi or bronchiole in a newborn. Line-and-dot pattern, which consists of multiple soft-tissue density linear and punctuate structures within cystic radiolucencies, is a typical radiologic appearance. For patients who demonstrate mild respiratory distress, treatment can be conservative, with low-volume and low-pressure ventilatory support given as needed. However, with more severe neonatal respiratory distress, emergent surgical resection of the affected lobe may be needed.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-889-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-889-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-889-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-889-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-889-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-889-6.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-889-7.jpg']",103,"['correct:4/103', 'diff:26/103']"

Chest CT taken 2 years later demonstrates increased cystic lesions with air-fluid levels.
The patient underwent right lower lobectomy and was pathologically diagnosed as CPAM(type 1) combined with pneumonia.","Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), previously known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM), is a rare developmental anomaly of the lower respiratory tract (1-5). They are still the most common congenital lung lesion. CPAMs occurs sporadically. Their formation is not related to maternal factor such as race, age, or exposures.
 Congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) result from abnormalities of branching morphogenesis of the lung. The different types of CPAMs are thought to originate at different levels of the tracheobronchial tree and at different stages of lung development, possibly influenced by in utero airway obstruction and/or atresia (6-8). 
 Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAMs) are hamartous lesions that are comprised of cystic and adenomatous elements arising from tracheal, bronchial, bronchiolar, or alveolar tissue. CPAMs have connections with the tracheobronchial tree, although the connecting bronchi are usually not normal. The arterial supply and venous drainage from the lesion are from the lesion are from the pulmonary circulation, though vascular connections to the systemic circulation have been reported. CPAMs are equally distributed between the right and left lungs and can arise in all lobes. The CPAMs that present during adulthood tent to be in the lower lobe (9).

 **Classification
 In 1997, Stocker et al (11), using specific gross and histologic criteria, classified CCAMs, which they subdesignated as type I (macrocystic, >2cm), type II (multiple smaller cysts), and type III (solid with microscopic cysts). In 2001, Stocker (12), expanded that classification, adding type 0 lesion (previously reported as acinar dysplasia of the lung) and type 4 lesions (a type of peripheral lung cyst manifesting with pneumothorax).
 Type 0 is the rarest form, comprising only 1 to 3 percent of cases. The cysts are small, with a maximum diameter of 0.5cm, and are lined with ciliated pseudostratified epithelium. This is a diffuse malformation that involves the entire lung. Gas exchange is severely impaired, and affected infants die at birth(6). 
 Type 1 is the most common form of CPAM, comprising 60 to 70 percent(6). They are comprised of distinct thin-walled distinct cysts 2 to 10 cm in diameter. The cysts are usually single but may be multiloculated. They are lined with ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium and the walls contain smooth muscle and elastic tissue. The clinical presentation of type 1 of CPAMs depends primary on the size of the cysts.
 Type 2 lesions comprise 15 to 20 percent of CPAMs. They consist of multiple cysts 0.5 to 2cm in diameter and solid areas that blend into adjacent normal tissue. The cysts resemble dilated terminal bronchioles and are lined with ciliated cuboidal or columnar epithelium. Other congenital anomalies are observed in patients with type 2 CPAM in up to 60 percent of cases(1, 6). These malformations include esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula, bilateral renal agenesis or dysgenesis, intestinal atresia, other pulmonary malformations, and diaphragmatic, cardiac, central nervous system, and bony anomalies.
 Type 3 CPAMs comprise 5 to 10 percent of CPAMs. They are often very large, and can involve and an entire lobe or several lobes. They have an acinar origin and consist of adenomatoid proliferation of distal airways or airspaces. They can be a mixture of cystic and solid tissue or be entirely solid. The numerous small cysts are less than 0.5 cm in diameter and are lined with nonciliated cuboidal epithelium. 
 Type 4 lesions comprise 10 to 15 percent of CPAMs. The cysts have a maximum diameter of 7 cm and consist of nonciliated, flattened, alveolar lining cells, with no mucus cells or skelectal muscle. Type 4 CPAMs may present at birth or in childhood, often with tension pneumothorax or infection, but they may also be identified as incidental findings in asymptomatic patients. Importantly, this type of CPAM is strongly associated with malignancy, especially with pleuropulmonary blastoma(PPB).","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-891-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-891-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-891-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-891-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-891-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-891-6.jpg']",95,"['correct:35/95', 'diff:14/95']"

Mucosal biopsy was done at bilateral proximal bronchus.

Primary tracheobronchial amyloidosis is generally not associated with parenchymal abnormalities. Amyloid materials deposit in the submucosal area and most commonly involve the entire trachea. Infrequently, a solitary submucosal nodule can be present. On CT, tracheobronchial amyloidosis usually leads to diffuse, concentric, smooth, or nodular thickening of the submucosal tracheal wall. Cartilage is normal but concentric calcification or ossification may occur without tracheomalacia. Bronchoscopy proved to be the most useful diagnostic method in establishing the diagnosis by biopsy.

On the enhanced chest CT, there is infiltrative soft tissue mass in the anterior mediastinum, encasing aorta and its branching vessels, SVC, trachea, both hilums, and heart. Diffuse enlargement of all ventricular and atrial walls is also noted. 20 months before, the patient was taken cardiac MR due to same symptom. MR images of short axis view show marked wall thickening of both atrium and ventricles. The thickened myocardium is seen as homogeneous SI on T1WI and T2WI with diffuse heterogeneous enhancement on T1CE. Large amount of pericardial effusion is combined. The diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was made by US-guided neck lymph node biopsy at right supraclavicular fossa.","Lymphoma of the heart and pericardium is usually present as one aspect of disseminated disease and rarely occurs as a primary malignancy. It accounts for 1.3% of primary cardiac tumors and 0.5% of extranodal lymphomas. Although secondary cardiac involvement by lymphoma is more common than primary involvement, to our knowledge fewer than 100 cases have been described in the English-language literature, mostly as case reports or in small case series. Secondary cardiac involvement of a malignant lymphoma is usually a late manifestation of the disease; therefore, cardiac failure as the initial presentation is extremely rare.
However, whether the lymphoma is primary or secondary, there are no differences in imaging findings between the two. Cardiac lymphomas are most commonly diffuse large cell lymphomas and frequently manifest as an ill-defined, infiltrative mass. Diffuse involvement pattern is uncommon. Atrial location is typical; the right atrium is most often affected. Pericardial thickening or effusion is often a common early feature of disease. Infiltration of atrial or ventricular walls with extension along epicardial surfaces is also a notable feature.
At CT, lymphomas commonly appear as an infiltrating epicardial or myocardial mass that is often isoattenuating to hypoattenuating relative to myocardium. Heterogeneous enhancement after administration of intravenous contrast material is routinely demonstrated. A curious feature of cardiac lymphoma is the tendency of the tumor to extend along the epicardial surfaces of the heart, primarily encasing adjacent structures including coronary arteries and the aortic root.
MR imaging best depicts the extent of myocardial and pericardial infiltration, primarily due to its superior capacity for tissue characterization and high spatial resolution. Masses can be relatively hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. However, the appearance can be variable, and the presence of isointense signal relative to cardiac muscle is not uncommon. Contrast enhancement is frequent and may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. Delayed-enhancement imaging with nulling of normal myocardium also aids in identifying the extent of tumor.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-893-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-893-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-893-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-893-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-893-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-893-6.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-893-7.jpg']",99,"['correct:37/99', 'diff:27/99', 'semi:4/99']"

Since these tumors can remain clinically silent, they may have already reached large dimensions by the time of diagnosis. This is especially true for those masses originating from the chest wall.

-Resulting from penetrating injury or intubation, blunt trauma, high-speed traffic accidents 
Tracheobronchial injuries affect 3% of all patients who sustain blunt chest trauma. 80% of intrathoracic tracheobronchial injuries are within 2.5 cm of the carina, most commonly involving the proximal right main stem bronchus. 80% of these patients die within 2 hr from associated injuries. Findings of airway rupture are sometimes subtle and may be overshadowed by the other injury.
 50 to 100% of patients who sustain blunt tracheobronchial injuries have major associated injuries, including esophageal perforation in up to 20%. The most frequent symptoms of all blunt airway injuries are dyspnea (76 to 100%) and hoarseness (46%). 
Chest radiography 
-  Pneumomediastinum(60%) 
-  Pneumothorax (up to 70%) 
-  Coexistence of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum; strongest indication of a bronchial rupture
-  persistant pneumothorax with a large air leak despite a well-placed chest tube 
-   in the case of complete transsection, the fallen lung sign of Kumpe 
-	overdistention of endotracheal tube cuff, displacement of endotracheal tube
CT is indicated in the stable patient for the evaluation of possible associated injuries. An unrevealing CT scan does not obviate bronchoscopy if intrathoracic tracheal rupture is suspected. The presence of significant air leak alone is sufficient to mandate bronchoscopy without the need for advanced imaging. 
The diagnosis of bronchial rupture depends on awareness of this possibility of severe thoracic trauma.
Primary airway repair is usually possible, except when there is significant destruction, in which case resection and reanastomosis should be performed. A small proportion of patients present in a delayed fashion, usually within 4 weeks of injury, with hemoptysis, pneumonitis, or both, complicating an obstructed airway.

Chest CT reveals an enhancing mass-like consolidation with internal calcification and peripheral GGO with smooth interstitial thickening and infiltration in right upper lobe. (Internal calcification is thought to sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis.)
After 2 months, plain chest radiograph shows decreased size of mass-like consolidation in right upper lobe.
The patient didn't have any symptoms except cough and the laboratory test revealed only mild leukocytosis and slightly elevated CRP. 
Bronchoscopic biopsy was done in right upper lobe posterior segment. Marked  lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with many IgG-and IgG4-positive cells, consistent  with  IgG4-related sclerosing disease.
","Immunoglobulin G4(IgG4)-related disease is a newly recognized fibroinflammatory condition characterized by tumefactive lesions, a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and, often but not always, elevated serum IgG4 concentrations. Epidemiologic characteristics shows the majority of patients are men (62 to 83%) and older than 50 years of age.
IgG4-related lung disease can be considered as an IgG4-related sclerosing inflammation along the entire intrapulmonary connective tissue. 
IgG4-related disease shows various types of pulmonary manifestations.  IgG4-related lung disease can be categorized into four types on the basis of the predominant CT findings: solid nodular, round-shaped ground glass opacity, alveolar interstitial, and bronchovascular.
The first is a solid nodular type. This type was characterized by the presence of a solitary solid lesion larger than 1.0 cm that included a mass.  The solid nodular type were initially thought to be primary lung cancer.
The next is a round-shaped GGO type, which was radiologically characterized by multiple round-shaped GGOs. The radiologic findings of this type resembled those of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. 
The third is the alveolar interstitial type, which is radiologically characterized by diffuse GGO, bronchiectasia, and honeycombing. The patients were initially suspected of having nonspecific interstitial pneumonia on the basis of radiologic findings. 
The last is the bronchovascular type. Radiologic finding of this type is thickening of bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septa. Sarcoidosis or lymphoproliferative disorders such as multicentric Castleman disease were radiologically suspected in those cases.
Glucocorticoids are typically the first line of therapy. Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate are used frequently as glucocorticoid-sparing agents or remission-maintenance drugs after glucocorticoid- induced remissions.

Lung setting image of the chest CT shows small ovoid shaped mass in the subpleural portion of right lower lobe of the lung. Bronchovascular bundles converge into the mass in a curvilinear way, forming whirling appearance or comet tail sign. Mediastinal setting image of chest CT Fig 3) shows homogeneous enhancement of the subpleural mass. Irregular pleural thickening of right lower thorax is present with volume loss of right lower lung, including adjacent area of the mass. Follow up CT showed no difference from the initial CT.
"," Round atelectasis is an unusual form of lung collapse that is adjacent to the pleura. This may simulate pulmonary neoplasm and often associated with asbestosis. The mechanism of round atelectasis is controversial and two main theories are suggested; pleural thickening and pleural effusion. Pleural effusion associated with asbestosis, tuberculosis, other infection, pulmonary infarction or uremic pleuritis may cause infolding of visceral pleura and curling of the adjacent lung in concentric fashion. Fibrous adhesions suspend and lead to additional distortion of the lung parenchyma. Another theory explains that pleural thickening and contraction may lead to shrinkage of the adjacent lung and develops into a round configuration. 
 The radiographic features of round atelectasis are characteristic; round or oval subpleural opacity, forming acute angle with pleura and commonly found in the posterior lower lungs. Adjacent pleural thickening is essential. Usually it presents as a single lesion, however multiple lesions may occur. 
CT findings of round atelectasis is similar as radiography findings; peripherally located round or oval mass with thickening of adjacent pleura. The characteristic CT feature is crowded and distorted bronchovascular bundles which converge and enter the mass, called as comet tail sign. Homogeneous enhancement is seen in contrast enhanced scans, and air-bronchogram may be seen within the mass. Overlying pleural thickening is well demonstrated. 
 The main differential diagnosis is bronchogenic carcinoma. The round atelectasis is usually stable, but may show very slow growing or spontaneous resolution. Confident diagnosis could be made by CT and no specific treatment is needed.

Others are found in the mainstem bronchi, lobar bronchi or, rarely, in the segmental bronchi and extrathoracic trachea. The most common site of the tumor in the trachea has been reported to be the posterolateral wall. 
 On CT, the tumor has a striking tendency toward submucosal extension that manifests as an intraluminal mass of soft tissue attenuation with extension through the tracheal wall, a diffuse or circumferential wall thickening of the trachea, a soft tissue mass filling the airway, or a homogeneous mass encircling the trachea with wall thickening in the transverse and longitudinal planes. The longitudinal extent of the tumor is greater than its transaxial extent. It shows better prognosis than squamous cell carcinoma (5yr survival; 65-100%) and relatively common late recurrence after surgery.

Although patients with acute tracheobronchitis usually have normal radiologic findings, tracheal or bronchial wall thickening may be seen occasionally. Type of bronchiolitis is characterized by the presence of centrilobular nodules and branching linear or nodular areas of increased attenuation having a 'tree-in-bud' appearance (1). Centrilobular nodular areas of increased opacity similar to those seen in Aspergillus bronchiolitis have been described in a number of conditions, including endobronchial spread of pulmonary tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, and viral and mycoplasma pneumonia (4).

 CEP is an idiopathic condition characterized by chronic and progressive clinical features and specific pathologic findings. The clinical manifestation is usually insidious, and the patient experiences symptoms for an average of 7.7 months before the diagnosis is made. Most patients are middle aged, and approximately 50% have asthma. Women are more frequently affected than men. Pulmonary function tests can be normal in mild cases but usually show restrictive defects. Peripheral blood eosinophilia is usually mild or moderate but occasionally is severe. The percentage of eosinophils in the BAL fluid is very high. Histologic examination typically shows accumulation of eosinophils and lymphocytes in the alveoli and interstitium, with interstitial fibrosis. An organizing pneumonia pattern or an eosinophilic abscess may also be seen. The essential histologic differences between AEP and CEP are related to the severity of damage to the basal lamina, and the amount of subsequent intraluminal fibrosis. The typical chest radiographic finding in CEP is nonsegmental peripheral airspace consolidation ('photographic negative shadow of pulmonary edema') involving mainly the upper lobes. However, this finding may be seen in less than 50% of cases. CT demonstrates typical nonsegmental areas of airspace consolidation with peripheral predominance. Less common findings include ground-glass opacities, nodules, and reticulation. These less common findings predominate in the later stages of CEP.

","Ganglioneuromas are benign tumors that originate from neural crest cells that make up the sympathetic ganglia along the spinal column and adrenal glands. Ganglioneuromas share a common histogenic lineage with ganlioneuroblastoma and neuroblastoma and represent the most benign and differentiated of this group. Neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastoma are essentially tumors of childhood (less than 10% occur in patients older than 20 years of age). Ganglioneuroma is often seen in children and adolescents but has a broader and more even age distribution, ranging from 1 to 50 years. There is no distribution difference between males and females.
Ganglioneuromas typically are well-encapsulated mass with a fibrous capsule that arise in the posterior mediastinum. .On chest radiograph, these tumors are elongated along axis of spine.

Multifocal Castleman disease usually manifests on chest radiographs with diffuse mediastinal widening. On CT, multifocal lymph node enlargement is noted.
Because of its highly vascular nature, hyaline-vascular Castleman disease usually enhances intensely following administration of intravenous contrast material. Plasma cell Castleman disease is less vascular, and typically shows less enhancement after contrast administration. On FDG-PET scans, the lesions are usually quite metabolically active, whether uni- or multifocal in nature.
Reported manifestations of lung involvement include a pulmonary mass, centrilobular nodules, septal thickening, and thin-walled cysts. Most patients with diffuse lung involvement have multifocal disease and the lung findings are usually due to associated lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis.

When located in the lung, this lymphoma appears to arise from bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). BALT lymphoma represents a low-grade B lymphocyte lymphoma that is composed of monotonous small lymphocytes with focal plasmacytoid features. The origin of the cell is thought to be a B lymphocyte from the marginal zone of the lymphoid follicle. 
The commonest radiological manifestations of pulmonary MALT lymphoma were pulmonary masses, or mass-like areas of consolidation and multiple pulmonary nodules. Common features associated with pulmonary MALT lymphoma included air bronchogram, a positive angiogram sign on contrast enhanced CT, a halo of ground-glass shadowing or peribronchovascular thickening at tumour margins and discret patches of ground-glass shadowing. It tends to be confined to the lung for a long time, without involvement of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes or other organs.

The chest CT findings of LMM, consisting of a small localized subpleural nodule or mass, shows overlapping features with solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura. Therefore, the diagnosis of LMM should be distinguished pathologically. LMM is classified as a separate entity among the pleural tumors in the 2004 World Health Organization classification and has epithelioid, sarcomatoid, or biphasic pattern. Epithelioid-type predominates, while biphasic or purely sarcomatoid forms are infrequent.
LMM should be distinguished from the diffuse malignant mesothelioma because of different biologic behavior and better prognosis; many cases, in fact, can apparently be cured with early surgical radical intervention. When these tumors recur, they tend to metastasize in the fashion of sarcomas.

"," Systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation, immune complex deposition, vasculitis, and vasculopathy. Over one-half of patients with SLE develop pulmonary disease, with pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, and lupus pneumonitis being the most common manifestations. 
 Pleural effusions are the most common manifestation of SLE in the respiratory system and are bilateral in approximately 50% of patients. Acute pneumonitis which occurs in up to 12% of patients manifests as unilateral or bilateral patchy consolidation, typically in the lung bases, resulting from alveolar capillary injury leading to edema and hemorrhage. An accompanying pleural effusion is often present. Focal consolidation from acute pneumonitis may be difficult to differentiate from that due to pneumonia, and, given that infection is more common, it is imperative to exclude an infectious source with both clinical and laboratory evaluation before considering lupus pneumonitis. Pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage is a rare complication of SLE and is either immune mediated or secondary to infection or uremia. Patients are typically acutely ill with hemoptysis, fever, cough, and hypoxemia, and blood loss can be extensive. Mortality rates of 70% to 90% have been reported. At chest radiography, patchy bilateral and acinar areas of increased opacity, predominantly in the lower lungs, may be present. Interstitial abnormalities are seen in approximately 30% of patients at high-resolution CT. They include interlobular septal thickening (33%), irregular linear hyperattenuating areas (33%), and architectural distortion (22%). Such abnormalities are usually mild and focal and diffuse disease occurs in only 4% of patients. Honeycombing is uncommon.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-912-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-912-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-912-3.jpg']",84,"['correct:9/84', 'diff:6/84']"

Classified as a separate entity among the pleural tumors in the 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, it is rare and little is known about its behavior. LMM usually has microscopic appearance of malignant mesothelioma, but without any evidence of diffuse spread. The diagnosis of LMM can only be distinguished pathologically in localized pleural mass, showed at CT scan and confirmed as localized uptake at FDG-PET. 
Generally approached by aggressive surgery, it follows a better course than diffuse form. 
There are relatively few detailed accounts of the histology of localized tumors. Most seem to be predominantly fibrous, but with varying cellularity. Epithelium-type predominates, while biphasic or purely sarcomatous forms are infrequent. 
Evidence of a significant association with asbestos exposure has not been recorded. 
The small number of reported cases makes it difficult to determine whether LMM is a separate clinical entity or simply a diffuse malignant mesothelioma diagnosed at an early stage or with a different pathologic presentation.

Fig. 2. Immunohistochemistry; PAS(+), Congo-red (-)","Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease characterized by abnormal intraalveolar accumulation of surfactant-like material. Three distinct subgroups of PAP are currently recognized: idiopathic, secondary, and congenital.
Patients with idiopathic or secondary PAP experience nonspecific, moderate respiratory symptoms including progressive dyspnea and dry or minimally productive cough. Less common signs and symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, low-grade fever, chest pain, and hemoptysis.
Classic radiographic finding is a helpful first step in diagnostic imaging but remains nonspecific for PAP. The typical radiograph reveals bilateral central and symmetric lung opacities, with relative sparing of the apices and costophrenic angles. 
The finding of CT is an appearance of 'crazy-paving' that defined as a network of smoothly thickened reticular lines superimposed on areas of ground-glass opacity. Areas of crazy-paving in PAP are typically widespread and bilateral, often with sharply marginated areas of geographic or lobular sparing. There are widely variable patterns of regional or zonal predominance, including symmetric or asymmetric apical, basilar, central, peripheral, lobar, or diffuse lung involvement. Although the CT finding of crazy-paving is highly characteristic of PAP, it is also seen in several infectious, hemorrhagic, neoplastic, inhalational, and idiopathic conditions as well as in straightforward hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Therefore, the radiologic differential diagnosis of crazy-paving is broad and includes left heart failure, pneumonia (especially pneumocystis pneumonia), alveolar hemorrhage, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, diffuse alveolar damage (adult respiratory distress syndrome), radiation- or drug-induced pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-916-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-916-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-916-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-916-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-916-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-916-6.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-916-7.jpg']",80,"['correct:46/80', 'diff:22/80']"

Pathologically, lymphocytic infiltrates are present through the stroma. Immunohistochemical staining with D2-40 confirms the proliferation of lymphatic channels. The smooth muscle fibers adjacent to the lymphatic channels are positive with Desmin and negative for HMB-45. These findings suggest the lymphangiomatosis rather than lymphangiomyomatosis.
","Diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis occurs predominantly in infants and children and is characterized by the proliferation of anastomosing lymphatics along the subpleural space and interlobular septa, and to a lesser degree along the bronchovascular bundles. D2-40 immunostain should aid in differentiating them from veins when muscularization of the lymphatics is present.
CT findings include diffuse thickening of the interlobular septa and bronchovascular bundle. Pleural effusion and pleural thickening are also prevalent. In some patients the condition may progress to end-stage lung disease and death, with no effective treatment except for lung transplantation. 
From a pure imaging standpoint, the primary differential considerations in cases of pulmonary lymphangiomatosis would include congestive heart failure, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, and Erdheim-Chester disease. In cases of congestive heart failure, there is often associated cardiomegaly and pulmonary venous hypertension seen on imaging. In cases of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, there is typically also prominence of the central pulmonary arteries.

There are said to be three mechanisms of bleeding in hemopneumothorax. First, bleeding can results from a torn adhesion between the parietal and visceral pleura. The site of bleeding is usually a small noncontractile vessel on the parietal pleura, where vascular adhesions exist. Second, bleeding may result from the rupture of vascularized bullae and underlying lung parenchyma. Third, it may result from torn congenitally aberrant vessels between the parietal pleura and bullae.
Although, there is still some debate about the management of the patient who stabilizes after a chest tube insertion without further blood loss, the predominant opinion favors prompt surgical management for most of the patients with SHP, particularly in a patient who is in shock, has rebleeding after lung expansion, or fails conservative management after 24 hours.

","Acute phlegmonous esophagitis is uncommon disorder. A bacterial infection occurs in the submucosa and musculature of the esophagus. Phlegmonous infection usually involves the submucosa and not the mucosa. Phlegmonous gastritis is more common than phlegmonous esophagitis and may be either localized or diffuse. 
The pathogenesis of acute phlegmonous esophagitis is unclear. Reported predisposing factors include immune suppression, alcoholism, peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis or some other gastric mucosal injury, achlorhydria, infection, connective tissue disease, and malignancy. Presumably, these conditions predispose the stomach to infection by eliminating various defense mechanisms, such as, inherent gastric cytoprotection or the bactericidal effect of gastric acid. Nevertheless, approximately 50% of reported cases were previously healthy and had no significant anteceding risk factors.
CT findings of phegmonous esophagitis are esophageal wall thickening and intramural low-density areas. The area of intramural low attenuation surrounded by a peripherally enhancing rim represents intramural abscess.

During the operation, left chest wall mass and adjacent ribs excision was performed. The pathology reported chronic inflammation with foreign body and foreign body type giant cells collection, which is consistent with paraffinoma considering the operative and clinical findings. ","In the belief that collapsing the lung around the foci of tuberculous infection provided for anatomic healing of the lesions, physicians in the first half of the 20th century performed artificial extrapleural pneumothorax. If the patient tolerated artificial pneumothorax well, the surgeon injected or implanted plombe, a space-filling substance, during a second operation in order to compress the lung. Many substances were tried as substrate for plombe, and they included fat, gauze packing, oil, paraffin wax, bone, rubber bag, muscle, and synthetic materials, such as methyl acrylate spheres, fiberglass, polyethylene sheeting, and polystan sponge. There were complications resulting from collapse therapy including infection of the plombage space, blood vessel erosion, hemorrhage, and breach of the underlying parenchymal cavitation. It is said that paraffin wax, the material presumably used as plombe in this patient, were more prone to infection and extrusion, and thus was largely replaced by methyl acrylate, or lucite balls. With time, it became apparent that lucite also causes complications such as migration into adjacent structures and erosion of overlying ribs. Plombage thoracoplasty was also known to cause neoplastic complications to the chest wall, including epithelioid angiosarcoma, lung carcinoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Performing extrapleural plombage for collapse therapy eventually fell out of favor as an optimal treatment for tuberculosis, largely due to introduction of antimicrobial therapy.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, has a variety of thoracic manifestations. Respiratory manifestations may involve the large and small airways, pulmonary vasculature, lung parenchyma, or serosal surface. In contrast to other extraintestinal manifestations, pulmonary parenchymal IBD is seen more commonly with ulcerative colitis than Crohn disease, and large airway disease is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis.
Airway inflammation is the most common form of respiratory involvement in IBD patients, predominantly affecting the intermediate sized central bronchi. Bronchiectasisis, chronic bronchitis, suppurative large airway disease without airway dilation, or acute bronchitis are seen. Chest radiographs may show increased interstitial markings or a tramline pattern or may appear normal. CT findings include diffuse concentric bronchial wall thickening with or without mucoid impaction and bronchiectasis.

It is endemic in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys, south America and Africa. It is very rare disease in Korea, there are only 3 case reports.
The majority of infected persons have an asymptomatic, self-limiting illness in 99.5% of infected individuals. The most common clinical presentation is solitary nodule on chest radiographs or CT images. These nodules correspond histologically to an encapsulated focus of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, and show central (target) or diffuse calcification radiologically, as a result of dystrophic calcification of necrotic material. CT is also very useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected fibrosing mediastinitis.
Chronic disease of histoplasmosis, which mimics tuberculosis, occurs almost exclusively in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Human infection results from ingestion of raw freshwater crab or crayfish infected with the metacercaria. They excyst in the small intestine, and the larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and enter the peritoneal space. Next they penetrate the diaphragm and pleura and enter the lung in 3-8 weeks, where they mature to adult flukes. The symptoms of the patients before admission are variable, including blood-tinged sputum, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and fever. Some patients are asymptomatic. The common CT findings include pleural effusion, hydropneumothorax, pulmonary nodules or air-space consolidation, and cysts. The round low-attenuation cystic lesions (5-15 mm) filled with either fluid or gas, within the consolidation are characteristic findings and the subpleural linear opacities or a tubular structure communicating with a cyst are suggestive of worm migration tracks. In a study of experimentally induced pulmonary paragonimiasis in 21 cats by Im et al, the appearance of pulmonary lesions varied with the stage of the infection and the surrounding tissue reaction. Early findings, which were caused by the migration of juvenile worms, included pneumothorax or hydropneumothorax, focal air-space consolidation, and linear opacities. Later findings resulting from worm cysts included thin-walled cysts, mass-like consolidation, nodules, or bronchiectasis. Kim et al., reported the characteristic findings of 31 paragonimiasis patients, with poorly marginated subpleural or subfissural nodule of about 2 cm in diameter that frequently contains a necrotic low-attenuation area and the constellation of focal pleural thickening and subpleural linear opacities leading to a necrotic peripheral pulmonary nodule. Pulmonary paragonimiasis can mimic lung cancer by showing a high FDG uptake on FDG PET.

An endocrine evaluation showed a corticotropin-dependent hypercortisolism, which was not suppressed with the administration of high-dose dexamethasone and could not be stimulated with the administration of corticotropin-releasing hormone, a finding that suggested a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome resulting from the ectopic secretion of corticotropin. There was no evidence of pituitary adenoma on brain MR and inferior petrosal sinus sampling was negative. The nodule in the left lower lobe assumed to be an ACTH producing carcinoid tumor and was resected. Final pathology was an atypical carcinoid tumor.","Many bronchopulmonary (BP)-carcinoids are detected incidentally on chest radiographs. Plain radiographs are nonspecific, although BP-carcinoids often appear as an isolated, well-defined hilar or perihilar mass. Once a suspicious lesion is detected on chest radiograph, CT of the chest and upper abdomen should be undertaken to determine the size, characteristics, extent of the primary tumor, involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes, and presence of distant metastases. Typical carcinoid tumor shows a well-defined, spherical or ovoid mass that narrow, deform, and/or obstruct airways. They tend to be vascular and are located close to central bronchi, often near the bifurcation area, whereas atypical carcinoid tumors usually are located peripherally in the lung. Calcification is evident in up to 30% of tumors and manifests in a punctuate or diffuse pattern. Typical as well as atypical carcinoid tumors may be associated with hilar or malignant lymphadenopathy. Cushing syndrome (ectopic production and secretion of ACTH) may occur in ~2% of BP-carcinoids, whereas <1% of individuals with Cushing syndrome have a BP carcinoid. Other, rare endocrine conditions associated with carcinoids include acromegaly, hypercalcemia, and hypoglycemia.

VATS biopsy specimen of the patient shows numerous brown pigmented alveolar macrophages filling alveolar duct and airspaces.","DIP is an uncommon form of interstitial pneumonia that occurs frequently in patients between 30 and 50 years of age. Approximately 90% are cigarette smokers. The DIP is characterized histologically by the presence of numerous macrophages within alveolar airspaces. A DIP-like histopatholgic pattern also has been associated with dust inhalation, metabolic diseases, drug reactions, and connective tissue disease. Unlike usual interstitial pneumonia, DIP involvement is typically more or less uniform in severity within affected lobules. Interstitial inflammation and fibrosis are usually mild but may be moderate or rarely severe. Similarly, architectural distortions of lung parenchyma and traction bronchiectasis are uncommon features. 
The most common radiographic appearance of DIP is bilateral basal hazy increased opacification with a reduction in lung volumes. However, the radiographs are normal in about 5% to 20% of patients who have biopsy-proven DIP. The predominant HRCT abnormality is also bilateral area of ground-glass attenuation, reflecting the filling of alveolar airspaces by macrophages. A subpleural and basal predominance is often present. Although reticular opacity may be associated with ground-glass attenuation, honeycombing is uncommon. Of cases, 32%-75% develop small cystic airspaces within areas of ground-glass attenuation. Histopathologic correlation suggests that some of these cysts represent bronchioliectasis and dilated alveolar ducts, without honeycomb fibrosis. Because of its association with cigarette smoking, centrilobular emphysema is also common present. Spontaneous improvement may occur in untreated patients.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common extra-articular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Histologic patterns of RA-associated ILD include usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP, most common pattern), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans, and follicular bronchiolitis (1).
RA-ILD with UIP pattern is associated with increased mortality and less responsive to conventional treatment compared with RA-ILD with non-UIP pattern. Therefore accurate identification of RA-ILD patients with UIP pattern is important. In patients with RA-ILD, a definite CT UIP pattern, characterized by basal and subpleural interstitial reticulations and fibrosis, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing, has a specificity of 96% and a sensitivity of 45% for the histopathologic UIP pattern.

The prevalence of PAP has been reported as 3.7-6.2 cases per million (2). PAP is strongly related with smoking and usually occurs in young and middle-aged adults with male predominance (2, 3). 
The characteristic finding of PAP is the filling of the alveolar spaces with fine granular eosinophilic and PAS-positive proteinaceous and lipid-rich surfactant-like material. Symptoms include dyspnea, non-productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, malaise and low grade fever (3). However, about one third of patients can be asymptomatic. 
Chest radiograph usually shows bilateral, symmetric air-space consolidation or ground-glass opacity with a perihilar or basal distribution. High resolution CT typically reveals patchy ground-glass opacity with superimposed smooth inter-lobular / intra-lobular septal thickening (crazy paving) in polygonal shapes (1, 3).  Although the distribution of PAP is usually predominant in perihilar / hilar area, PAP could affect the subpleural areas of the lung predominantly in some cases (4, 5). 
The standard for the diagnosis of PAP is the lung biopsy. The bronchoalveolar larvage can be helpful in the diagnosis (2).

","Esophageal lung or esophageal lobe is one of the entities in the communicating bronchopulmonary foregut malformations (CBPFM). This condition is more common in females, with a ratio 1.5 to 1 as compared to males. The right lung is more commonly involved. 
Clinical manifestations are variable, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening respiratory failure. The most common presentation is recurrent chest infections with coughing on ingestion of fluids or food. Most of the early presenting patients have poor prognosis.
Confirmation of the diagnosis of esophageal lung is obtained by barium opacification of the esophagus, which shows directly the esophageal bronchus and its first division branches. 
Since pulmonary sequestration may be associated with the condition, an angiographic study of the arterial vascularization of the lungs is necessary if conservative surgery has to be performed.
The advanced age of presentation and the absence of symptoms to the bronchial passage of food/fluids emphasize the need to have the possibility of CBPFM in the differential diagosis, even in adults.

Chest CT demonstrates multiple bilateral randomly distributed ground-glass attenuation micronodules. Many nodules show central cavitation. No zonal predominance is seen.
VATS biopsy was done in the right middle and lower lobe and diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis was confirmed."," Pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules (PMLNs) have been found in patients ranging in age from 12 to 91 years, mostly in the seventh decade of life with a marked female predilection. Pathologically, PMLNs are small (100 um to a few mm) nodules which are composed of cells similar with meningothelial cells. Most PMLNs are usually solitary and found incidentally without related clinical manifestations during testing for other diseases. However, multiple lesions can be encountered and have occurred in up to 41% of all patients with PMLNs. If these lesions are small and numerous, this condition has been termed as diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM).
 Radiologic features of DPM are nonspecific, but, scattered minute areas of ground-glass attenuation are characteristic. The lesions presented in a random distribution but had a tendency to be located in the periphery of the lung. There is an assumption that the spread of the lesion along the alveolar walls likely results in the ground-glass attenuation on HRCT.
 It has benign course, thus, conservative treatment is favorable. Therefore, this entity should be distinguished from metastatic carcinomas with prominent lymphatic spread in the lungs. However, recent studies reported that DPM have been associated with a variety of pulmonary abnormalities including pulmonary thromboembolism, and neoplasm, particularly pulmonary adenocarcinoma.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-951-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-951-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-951-3.jpg']",81,"['correct:2/81', 'diff:2/81']"

Laboratory data of the patient showed positive for O. tsutsugamushi antibody, mild LFT abnormality and increased CRP (C-reactive protein).","Scrub typhus (tsutsugamushi disease) is an acute febrile illness caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, characterized by focal or disseminated vasculitis and perivasculitis, which may involve the lungs, heart, liver, spleen, and central nervous system. Scrub typhus has epidemics in the late fall that affect a wide area of South-East Asia and the Pacific rim including the Korean Peninsula. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of mites or chiggers. 
The diagnosis of scrub typhus is based on history of exposure, clinical features and serological testing. The main clinical manifestations are high fever, skin rash, myalgia, lymph node enlargement and characteristic eschar formation at the site of chigger feeding. The clinical course is usually mild and self-limited with spontaneous recovery after a few days, but some patients have a more severe course which may be fatal.
The radiological findings of scrub typhus are variable, ranging from normal to fulminant pulmonary edema. On chest radiography, bilateral diffuse areas of reticulonodular opacity, hilar lymph node enlargement, and septal lines are the most common findings. Airspace consolidation is relatively uncommon and generally appears in the lower zone of both lungs. Unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion is common, found in 12-43% of patients. On high-resolution CT, interlobular septal thickening, axial interstitial thickening, ground-glass opacity, and centriloular nodules with lower lung predilection are common findings. Consolidation and large nodules are less common. CT findings of scrub typhus may reflect cellular infiltration, edema, and hemorrhage caused by vasculitis or may be due to interstitial edema secondary to cardiac involvement.

The terms Non-small cell lung cancer is classified into specific subtypes, such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma represents the most common histologic subtype world-wide, accounting for almost half of all lung cancers. Recently, classification of lung adenocarcinoma was modified to revise for the growing need for universally accepted criteria organizing the widely divergent clinical, radiologic, and pathologic spectrum of adenocarcinoma. The terms “bronchioloalveolar carcinoma” (BAC) and “mixed subtype adenocarcinoma” have been suggested for revision. Based on the pathologic features of resection specimens, small solitary adnocarcinomas (less than 3 cm in diameter) are defined as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) with pure lepidic growth and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) with predominant lepidic growth and less than 5 mm invasion. Invasive adenocarcinomas have been classified as lepidic (formerly nonmucinous BAC pattern with more than 5 mm invasion), acinar, papillary, and solid predominany patterns, and micropapillary predominant pattern was recently added as a new histologicc sub type.Variants of invasive adenocarcinoma (formerly mucinous BAC), colloid, fetal, and enteric adenocarcinoma.
CT features of adenocarcinoma have been described as pure ground glass-attenuated nodules, solid nodules, or part-solid nodules. Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) appears as a small (usually less than 5mm) nonsolid nodule, and shows ground-glass attenuation within which the margins of normal structures remain outlined. AAH can be single or multiple. Non-mucinous AIS generally appears as a pure GGN, but may sometimes be observed as a part-solid nodule. Invasive adenocarcinoma is usually a solid nodule or mass with a variable extent of ground-glass attenuation. The ground glass component is correlated with a lepidic pattern and solid component with an invasive pattern. A marginal characteristic of thick spiculation is associated with lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion.

","ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis (Wegener granulomatosis) is an uncommon necrotizing vasculitis affecting multiple organ systems. Classical manifestation is a clinical triad consisting of upper airway (almost 100%) and lower airway involvement (90%) and renal involvement (80%) such as glomerulonephritis although it may involve any part of the body. Patient symptom varies and depends on the organ system affected. Patients with pulmonary involvement often complain of cough with or without hemoptysis, dyspnea, fever, and chest pain. Elevation of serum cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) titers, usually directed toward proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase, occurs in up to 90% of patients with active ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis.
Pulmonary nodules and masses are the most common CT findings of ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis and are seen in up to 70% of patients. Waxing and waning of the single or multiple pulmonary nodules and masses with random distribution are features of the disease. Central cavitation occurs in up to 50% of cases and and most noncavitated nodules or masses show central low attenuation reflecting extensive central necrosis. CT halo sign (up to 15%) or reverse halo sign, radiating linear scarring, and pleural tags can be ancillary findings. Diffuse ground-glass opacity and consolidation (50%) may result from pulmonary hemorrhage or infection and bilateral perihilar and peribronchovascular distributions are the most common. The tracheobronchial tree is the second most commonly affected area in the thorax (16-23% of cases) and subglottic portion of the trachea is most often common location. Segmental,focal, circumferential wall thickening involving the posterior membrane of the trachea is the typical radiologic findings. Pleural involvement (12-20% of the patient) causing pleural effusion and pleuritis and cardiac involvement as a form of pericarditis, coronary arteritis and myocardial ischemia owing to the vasculitis in small to medium-sized coronary artery could be also presented. 
Without treatment, approximately 90% of patients with ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis die within 2 years of diagnosis. Aggressive immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide is the best current therapy (remission rate; 87%). In April 2011, the FDA approved rituximab (a chimeric antibody to CD20 protein) in combination with steroids to treat patients with ANCA-associated granulomatous, but relapse is still common.

The patient was confirmed with ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis, named Wegener granulomatosis in the past.
Pathologic findings are geographic necrosis with areas of vasculitis and eosinophilic infiltrates. EVG special stain demonstrates necrotizing vasculitis in small- and medium-sized arteries.
","ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis (AGV) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that usually involves upper airway disease (almost always involvement; nasal, oral, or sinus inflammation from chronic sinusitis to septal perforation), lower respiratory airway disease (90%; lung), kidney (80%; from segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis to rarely RCC) and other less common organs including skin-purpura, PNS-sensory neuropathy and cardiac involvement. Lung biopsy of AGV shows a granulomatous small-vessel necrotizing vasculitis. AGV most commonly occurs in whites and affects men and women equally and the mean age is 40 years. Elevation of serum cytoplasmic antineutrophil antibodies against protease 3 in cytoplasmic granules(c-ANCA) is positive more than 90% of patients with active stage of AGV. Patients with AGV have respiratory symptom such as hemoptysis, cough and dyspnea.
CT is sensitive for detection of lung involvement. Lung nodules and masses are the most common manifestation of AGV (40~70%) presenting multiply, bilaterally and without a zonal predilection and usually measuring between 2 and 4cm. The CT halo sign (a rim of GGO surrounding a nodule) is seen in 15% and most noncavitated nodules or masses show central low attenuation reflecting extensive central necrosis. The nodules may occur in a centrilobular distribution. Cavitation with thin or thick wall occurs in 25% of nodules larger than 2 cm. Approximately 50% of the nodules and masses resolve responding to treatment, 40% decrease in size and 10% remain unchanged. Air-fluid level in cavity is more suggestive of pulmonary infection rather than primary cavity of AGV.
Airspace consolidation and ground-glass opacity (20-50%) may result from alveolar hemorrhage or pneumonitis. They may have a random distribution, a peribronchial distribution, or appear as peripheral wedge-shaped lesions mimicking pulmonary infarction.
Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage occurs in 10% of patients with AGV, airway involvement in 15-25% as form of subglottic tracheal and/or bronchial stenosis in the central airways.

Medially, the structure is seen between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries. At more caudal levels, the structure is seen in cross section on axial CT, appearing as a hypoattenuating dot adjacent to the esophagus (Fig 3-8, arrow). While the structure is located left anterolateral to the esophagus just above the aortic arch (Fig 3-4), it is located left lateral or left posterolateral to it at the levels of the aortic arch (Fig 5-7). At the level of the left atrium, the structure is seen posterior to the esophagus (Fig 8). The course and appearance of this structure are typical for a normal thoracic duct","Anatomically, the cisterna chyli is located at the level of the first lumbar vertebra on the right, and the duct then ascends through the right abdomen and chest [1]. At the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra, the thoracic duct crosses to the left and continues superiorly. Above the clavicle, the thoracic duct forms an arch that rises 3-5 cm above the clavicle [2]. The duct then angles forward, running posterior to the left common carotid artery, and terminates in the posterolateral aspect of the left internal jugular vein-left subclavian vein junction). 
 Kiyonaga et al. have shown that thin-slice axial and MPR CT images can sufficiently depict the lower and middle sections of the thoracic duct and the cisterna chyli [3].

Segmental fusiform configuration (segmental dilation of the distal duct), as seen in the present case, was noted in 19 (12%) cases [1]. 15 of those 161 ducts had IV contrast reflex into the terminal portion.

In our own experience, stack mode has been helpful identifying the thoracic duct in the axial CT: It can be seen as a low-density spot rotating half-circle around the esophagus (from 2 o'clock direction just above the aortic arch to 7 o'clock direction at the level of the first lumbar spine).
Hayashi et al. performed MR lymphography with a short echo spacing, 3D, half-Fourier, fast spin-echo sequence, successfully depicting the thoracic duct in six healthy volunteers [4].

But next day, she was finally admitted presenting with progressed symptoms including high fever, mental decrease and low blood pressure. Retropharyngeal abscess combined with descending necrotizing mediastinitis was diagnosed by enhanced chest and neck CT, so emergent thoracotomy, mediastinal dissection and surgical drainage were performed. Lots of tissue necrosis and pus were found in mediastinum and retropharyngeal space of the neck. After two months of surgical drainage and medical treatment, she recovered and discharged. ","Descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM) is a rare and very severe infection (mortality up to 50%) complicating a primary odontogenic or pharyngeal focus.  Gravity and negative intrathoracic pressure facilitate the spread of infection. The retropharyngeal space, called as ""dangerous space"", is rapid spreading route to the mediastinum. The incidence significantly increases in immunocompromised patients. 
Clinical symptoms are fever, odynophagia, dysphonia, dry cough, neck swelling and chest pain. Laboratory work-up may show leukocytosis or leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and raised acute phase proteins. 
Radiologic imaging plays a vital role in the diagnosis of DNM. Chest X-ray may show mediastinal widening, pleural effusion, pneumomediastinum. Neck and chest CT are more sensitive and may show fluid collections, with or without gas, increased density of cervical fat, or cellulitis, myositis, cervical lymphadenopathy, fluid collection in the mediastinum, pleura, and pericardium and vascular thrombosis. Key point of diagnosis is establishing the pathway for the spread from the neck to the mediastinum.

Abdomen CT(below) reveals pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst.
On pleural fluid analysis, amylase was increased 4800 U/L.","1.Introduction
-Abnormal communication between the pancreas and pleural cavity
-Cause: leakage of pancreatic secretion from damaged ducts, leakage from pancreatic pseudocyst, trauma (less common, 0~5% of reported cases)
-Unusual complication of chronic pancreatitis (0.4% of patients with chronic pancreatitism and 4.5% of patients with pancreatic pseudocyst)
-Possible mechanism of pathogenesis
 Leakage from ruptured pseudocyst or direct pancreatic duct leakage --> pancreatic enzymes entering into chest erode the pleural lining and disrupt subpleural vessels --> bleeding into pleural space

2.Clinical manifestation
-Predominantly present in alcoholic middle-aged men (only half of them have clinical histories of previous pancreatitis)
-Lt. pleural effusion (51%), Rt. (32%), bilateral (16%)
-Diagnosis
i.Markedly elevated amylase in the pleural fluid: most important (>1,000 IU/L, protein >3.0 g/dL), commonly show several thousand units
(ddx.> malignancy, esophageal perforation)
ii.Amylase isoenzyme analysis: ~100% pancreatic amylase
iii.Serum amylase: usually mildly elevated

3.	Radiologic feature: ERCP and CT will identify actual fistulous tract in 70%
-CT
 Peripancreatic fluid collections were located along the fistulous tract that dissected into the mediastinum through esophageal or aortic hiatus

-MRCP
 Method of choice for suspected PPF, sensitivity 80%
 Noninvasiveness, possibility to detect the fistula even in case of severe strictures of the pancreatic duct
-ERCP
 2nd. Effective modality to diagnose PPF, sensitivity 46-78%
 Invasive, but possible simultaneous endoscopic treatment
 Ineffective in anatomic anomalies of pancreatic ducts, severe ductal strictures or obstructions
 Value of ERCP may improved by performing CT scan after endoscopy to determine the course of fistula filled with contrast medium

4.Treatment and prognosis
-Conservative management: control of pleural effusion (intercostals tube drainage), NPO, octreotide acetate
 48% fistula closure over a 2-3 week period
-Transpapillary nasopancreatic drain (fails to heal within 2-3 weeks)
-Surgical treatment: depending on the local anatomy, distal pancreatectomy, pancreatojejunostomy of fistula closure via transthoracic approach

Low density lesions with weak enhancement are revealed in the retrocrural and retroperitoneal regions. On FDG-PET, there is no appreciable FDG uptake by masses. Retrocrural lymphangioleiomyoma is identified after surgical resection, and pulmonary lesions by VATS biopsy. 
","Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare interstitial lung disease that affects women exclusively, typically during their reproductive years. LAM is characterized by the abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle cells (LAM cells) in the lungs, and thoracic and retroperitoneal lymphatics. The primary target of LAM is the chest. However, extrapulmonary LAM rarely occurs with or without subsequent involvement of the lung. 
21% of pulmonary LAM patients had extrapulmonary lymphangioleiomyomas. Avila et al. observed a positive trend between the presence of lymphangioleiomyomas and the severity of lung disease, with the probability of lymphangioleiomyomas increasing severity of the lung disease (p=0.12). 
Diurnal variation of lymphangioleiomyomas with normal morning pressure and increasing size of mass in the afternoon resulting from increased chyle during the day after meal and exercise provides useful radiographic features in distinguishing lymphangioleiomyomas (when it has thick and irregular wall, or solid), from lymphoma, solid lymphatic mass, and sarcoma.

B.The method was first described by Galibert in 1987 and has since become a standard treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and osteolytic vertebral tumours.
C.Because the cement is injected into the vertebral body under high pressure there is a high risk of it entering the perivertebral venous plexus (segmental vein), vena cava and eventually into the pulmonary arteries.

In many literatures, lung involvement of lymphoma presents many kinds of disease pattern such as nodules, GGO, interlobular septal thickening, and airspace consolidations. And also many cases of pulmonary lymphoma shows with or without mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However in this case there seldom found mediastinal lymphadenitis despite bilateral large consolidations. And there were several retroperitoneal soft tissue attenuation and lymph nodes on abdomen CT. 
Primary pulmonary lymphoma represent only 0.5% of all pulmonary lung neoplasm. It usually present with localized areas of consolidation on chest radiographs and CT scans. Air-bronchograms are commonly present. Less-common radiographic patterns of primary lymphoma of the lung include nodules, diffuse bilateral airspace consolidation, and segment or lobar atelectasis. Pleural involvement is rare.
Recurrent or secondary pulmonary involvement is much common and originates from nodal or extrathoracic lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the commonest type of lymphoma overall, mainly represented by the multiple mature B-cell subtypes. Nearly half of these patients have intrathoracic disease at presentation. It may result from direct mediastinal node extension, from lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination from distant sites, or from parenchymal lymphoid tissues. Bronchovascular extension of mediastinal and hilar disease occurs most frequently and result in a reticulonocular pattern. On radiologic findings, there ar various patterns: bronchovascular or lymphangitic with thickening of bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septa, discrete pulmonary nodules, pneumonic or alveolar with areas of consolidation, and military or hematogenous with disseminated micronodules.

Bronchoscopy was performed and there were hyperemic mucosal swelling and bronchial narrowing of bronchus intermedius due to extrinsic compression. The result of initial bronchocopic biopsy was revealed as negative finding. Thereafter, the patients underwent VATS biopsy. Deep biopsy was done twice and no malignant cell was identified at each time. On histopathologic examination, specimen was composed of lymphoplasma cells and histiocytes without remarkable increase in IgG4 positive cells. The final pathologic diagnosis was established as and inflammatory pseudotumor. "," An inflammatory pseudotumor arising solely in the mediastinum is very rare, few cases having been reported in the literature. There is considerable diversity of appearance of inflammatory pseudotumor on CT in cases. The radiographic appearance of inflammatory pseudotumor is quite variable and nonspecific. The most common radiographic presentation is that of a solitary well-circumscribed lobulating pulmonary mass with lower lobe predominance. Lesions can have low, equal, or high attenuation compared with the surrounding tissue. Variable enhancement patterns have been described on contrast enhanced CT scans, including no enhancement, mild enhancement, heterogeneous enhancement and peripheral enhancement. Variable calcification patterns have been described on CT scans including punctuate, dense, flocculent and curvilinear. In most cases, the lesion is usually intraparenchymal with secondary compression and entrapment of bronchi occurring with growth. Occasionally, endobronchial and endotracheal lesions may cause post obstructive pneumonia or atelectasis.
 Inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) is a quasineoplastic lesion consisting of inflammatory cells and myofibroblastic spindle cells. It most commonly involves the lung and orbit but found in nearly every site in the body. They are also known as plasma cell granuloma, histiocytoma, and fibroxanthoma depending on the predominant cell type. These tumors have no sex predilection, and their peak prevalence is in the second decade of life. Cough, fever, dyspnea, and hemoptysis are the usual presenting symptoms.

Approximately 30% of these tumors are malignant, although they have a good prognosis. It is unassociated with asbestos exposure.
LFT is usually detected incidentally on chest radiographs. However, it can be associated with hypoglycemia (5% of cases) due to production of insulin-like growth factor type 2 (IGF-2), hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (one third of cases), or chest pain. The symptoms resolve with resection.
LFT arises from the visceral pleura in 70%. It typically appears as a solitary, smooth, sharply defined, often large lesion, contacting a pleural surface. When small, LFT tends to have obtuse angles at the pleural surface; when large, the angles are usually acute. LFT can be seen within a fissure, mimicking the appearance of loculated fluid. A “beak” or “thorn” sign is often visible on plain radiographs in patients with an LFT originating in or projecting into a fissure. They may also arise on a stalk and move with change in patient position. Pleural effusion is not usually present.
On CT, even if acute angles are visible, slight pleural thickening is usually visible adjacent to the mass. This thickening may reflect a small amount of fluid accumulating in the pleural space at the point where the visceral and parietal pleural surfaces area separated by the tumor.

Chest CT demonstrates multifocal GGOs in the lung parenchyma with sparing peripheral/hilar area at both lungs.

This patient was diagnosed with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma with bone metastasis 3 months ago. He underwent angiography with 99mTc-MAA in the proper hepatic artery and scintigraphy demonstrated a hepatopulmonary shunt of 15%. Then he underwent transarterial radioembolization (TARE) for the HCC.
After 3 months, the patient exhibited worsening of dyspnea. Chest PA and CT findings were typically suggestive of radiation pneumonitis due to TARE. He expired 1 month later.","Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a technique for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases with catheter-directed intraarterial administration of yttrium-90 (90Y) resin or glass microspheres. This technique uses the dual hepatic blood supply to deliver a therapeutic radiation dose greater than 200 Gy to tumors while delivering less than 10 Gy to the normal liver parenchyma. The average diameter of these microspheres is 29-35μm and lodged in small hepatic arterioles.         
After intra-arterial injection of Y-90 microspheres into the liver, a small fraction of the radioactive substance is shunted into the lung via intrametastatic arteriovenous shunts. If a large proportion of the injected radionuclide microspheres is shunted into the lung, the risk of radiation-induced pneumonitis is increased.
In the absence of pathologically proven microsphere deposition, radiation pneumonitis is a diagnosis of exclusion based on clinical, functional, and radiographic ﬁndings without other infectious/inﬂammatory/cytotoxic etiologies. Patients present with nonproductive cough, dyspnea, fever, and bronchoalveolar lymphocytosis and eosinophilia. Functionally, radiation pneumonitis initially presents as a mild restrictive process on pulmonary testing. 
Radiographically, radiation pneumonitis presents 1–2 months after therapy with ill-deﬁned patchy opacities and ground-glass nodularity in a asymmetric pattern with relative peripheral/hilar sparing (due to diameter of microshperes). These may resolve or progress toward localized ﬁbrosis, traction bronchiectasis, and focal honeycombing. Late complications include pneumothorax and superinfections. 
All undergo initial evaluation to assess for tumor-induced arteriovenous shunting to the lung parenchyma with the use of intraarterial technetium-99m (99mTc) macroaggregated albumin (MAA) administration and quantitative scintigraphy. MAA can pass through tumor-associated arteriovenous shunts and become deposited in the pulmonary vasculature. Radioemboization should be avoided in patients with a lung shunt fraction of 13-20% or higher.

","Adenoid cystic carcinoma generally occurs in the salivary glands. Pulmonary adenoid cystic carcinomas are rare, originating from submucosal glands of the airway and the majority developing in the lower trachea and mainstem bronchi. It is known to have no definite association with smoking and is prevalent in the 4th and 5th decade. Clinical manifestations are usually related to airway obstruction such as dyspnea, cough, stridor and wheezing. 
	On CT, adenoid cystic carcinoma appears as an intraluminal mass of soft tissue attenuation and has a tendency toward submucosal extension. The tumor may appear as a circumferential wall thickening, a homogeneous mass encircling the trachea or a soft tissue mass filling the airway. Longitudinal extent is usually greater than axial extent.
Adenoid cystic carcinoma is generally regarded as a slow growing, low grade malignancy, which has a tendency for local recurrence. Surgical resection should be performed whenever possible and in inoperable cases, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be considered.

Iniital chest CT scan shows small amount of pericardial effusion and left pleural effusion. The 2 months follow up chest CT scan shows increased amount of septated pericardial effusion with heterogeneous enhancing infiltrative soft tissue mass along the pericardium. PET-CT shows infiltrative mass lesions along the pericardium with intensely increased FDG uptake combining with loculated pericardial effusion.

 This patient was complained of recurrent pericardial effusion and was diagnosed on pericardial biopsy as pericardial mesothelioma and treated by pericardiectomy with partial resection of the mass under mid-sternotomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. "," Primary pericardial tumors are rare and can be benign (teratoma, fibroma, angioma, lipoma) or malignant (mesothelioma, sarcoma). Secondary tumors are more common, metastasizing mostly from the lung, breast, melanomas, lymphoma, or leukemia. The incidence of malignant pericardial involvement has been reported in the literature from 0.15−21% of all patients with an underlying malignancy. It is estimated that of all patients with malignant cardiac involvement, about 85% have pericardial involvement. Prognosis is poor with survival after diagnosis ranging from six weeks to 15 months. 
Pericardial mesothelioma is extremely rare, although it is the most common primary malignant pericardial tumor. Pericardial mesothelioma can present as a localized or as a diffuse mass. Three histological types have been described: epithelial, spindle cell, and mixed. There is a possible relation to asbestos exposure but this is seen only in cases with coexistent asbestos related pleural disease. 
 The onset of symptoms is usually insidious. Common clinical manifestations of pericardial mesothelioma are constrictive pericarditis, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and heart failure caused by myocardial infiltration. Further symptoms may arise due to compression of coronary arteries and local spread into the surrounding great vessels. Primary mesothelioma can also mimic tuberculous pericarditis or intra-atrial myxomas. Distant metastasis, conduction block due to myocardial infiltration,5 and tumour embolism causing neurological deficits have also been reported. 
Pericardial fluid in pericardial mesothelioma can be difficult to aspirate. A multimodal imaging approach, including echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and FDG-PET scans, is required. Chest radiography of patients reveals cardiomegaly, an irregular cardiac silhouette or diffuse mediastinal enlargement. Transthoracic echocardiography is the mainstay imaging technique for cardiac tumor detection. CT scan can demonstrate the extent of the cardiac tumor, the extent of pericardial thickening, the mediastinal lymph node and the extracardiac lesions. Cardiovascular MRI is the reference non-invasive imaging technique for assessment and characterization of a suspected cardiac mass. It allows accurate confirmation of the presence of a space occupying lesion, localization and assessment of the extent of involvement, evaluation of the functional impact of the lesions, as well as tissue characterization. However, in a recent report, PET-CT was useful in the staging and preoperative evaluation of pleural or pericardial mesothelioma, detection of unsuspected nodal and occult distant metastases (Ost et al., 2008). Other investigations such as immunohistochemistry, cytological examination, and high pericardial hyaluronic acid content of the pericardial aspirate can be diagnostic. The abnormal pericardium has also been known to take up gallium 67 extensively at scintigraphy. 
Pericardial mesothelioma responds poorly to radiotherapy. Cyclical combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide may reduce the tumor mass. Surgical resection can be curative in localized cases. Palliative treatment includes pericardiectomy, which prevents cardiac tamponade and relieves constriction. Alternatively, a pericardial window can be formed to introduce chemotherapeutic agents. Areas of ongoing research include intracavitary chemotherapy and irradiation. Photodynamic treatment, inhibition of growth factors, vaccines, and adenoviral molecular chemotherapy are also being expored.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-979-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-979-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-979-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-979-4.jpg']",83,"['correct:21/83', 'diff:25/83', 'semi:1/83']"

Mediastinoscopic biopsy reveals inflammatory fibrous tissue containing a few plasma cells and lymphocyte infiltration and that were not stained for IgG4. ","Fibrosing mediastinitis (chronic sclerosing mediastinitis, granulomatous mediastinitis, or idiopathic mediastinal fibrosis) is a rare condition characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis of mediastinal soft tissues. The clinical, radiological and pathological presentation of fibrosing mediastitis within the mediastinum is highly compatible with the disease of IgG4 related disease in other organ such as the pancreas and the salivary glands. But the immunological characteristics are not consistent with IgG4 related disease in this case.
The exact pathogenesis of the mediastinal fibrosis is unclear, although tuberculosis, syphilis, histoplasmosis and blastomycosis have all been suggested as aetiological factors, as well as immune reactions, drugs, trauma and malignancy. The disease is exceptionally rare in Europe, with most cases reported originating from the United States, where it is often associated with fungal infections, particularly histoplasmosis
Most patients present with signs or symptoms related to obstruction or compression of vital mediastinal structures such as the central airways, superior vena cava, pulmonary veins, pulmonary arteries and esophagus. The most common presenting complaints include cough, dyspnea, recurrent pulmonary infection, hempotysis, and pleuritic chest pain.
Sherrick et al identified two patterns of involvement on CT scans: a focal pattern and a diffuse pattern. The focal pattern, seen in 82% of cases, manfests as a mass of soft-tissue attenuation that is frequently calcified (63% of cases) and is usually located in the fight paratracheal or subcarinal regions or in the hila. This type of fibrosing mediastinitis is, in all probability, caused by histoplasmosis in patients from the United States. The diffuse pattern, seen in 18% of cases, manifests as a diffusely infiltrating, noncalcified mass that affects multiple mediastinal compartments. The diffuse pattern is probaly not related to histopsmosis but often occurs in the setting of other idiopathic fibrosing disorders such as retoperitoneal fibrosis.
Fibrosing mediastinitis typically manifests on CT scans as an infiltrative mass of soft-tissue attenuation obliterating normal mediastinal fat planes and encasing or invading adjacent structures. Fibrosing mediastinitis most commonly affects the middle mediastinal compartments, including both the paratracheal and subcarinal regions, and the hila.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-980-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-980-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-980-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-980-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-980-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-980-6.jpg']",73,"['correct:10/73', 'diff:13/73', 'semi:7/73']"

Follow up CT images performed 10 days later showed consolidation with peripheral GGO and interlobular septal thickening, demonstrating a crazy-paving pattern appearance, the extent of which was increased compared with the initial CT scan. 
A video-associated thoracoscopic (VATS) biopsy was performed to obtain a diagnosis, and the patient was subsequently diagnosed with PAP.
","PAP is a relatively rare disease that is classified into idiopathic and secondary forms based on the presence of hematologic malignancy, compromised immunity, or exposure to materials such as silica and cement. PAP consists of intra-alveolar accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material resulting from a defective turnover of surfactant. In addition, there is typically a uniform accumulation of PAS-positive material in all alveolar spaces. Electron microscopy shows that the intraalveolar material consists of amorphous, granular debris containing numerous osmiophilic, fused membrane structures with a periodicity of 4.7 nm and resembling lamellar bodies and tubular myelin. 
Although typical CT features of PAP are GGO with interlobular septal thickening (crazy-paving appearance), distributed diffusely or geographically involving the bilateral lung parenchyma, various CT image findings are possible ranging from GGO to dense consolidation. 
The majority of the literature investigating CT finding of PAP have reported the diffusely and bilaterally distributed crazy-paving appearance, and little reports of unilateral or asymmetric patterns of PAP were suggested. In the case presented here, nodular and localized pattern of PAP is rare and interesting manifestations. In conclusion, it is important for radiologists to be aware of potential atypical imaging findings of PAP in order to provide a correct diagnosis. Along these lines, PAP can present as a solitary nodular lesion or unilateral focal lesion.

","Human paragonimiasis is caused by the trematode Paragonimus westermani or other Paragonimus species through the ingestion of raw or partially cooked freshwater crabs or crayfish infected with the metacercaria. The main endemic areas are east Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America (primarily Peru), and Africa (primarily Nigeria). Many cases have been reported in the United States among Indo-Chinese and Latin American immigrants. It is believed that 195 million people are at risk, and 20.7 million are infected in endemic areas.
The lung is the target organ, although cutaneous and cerebral paragonimiasis have also been described. Patients present with fever, chest pain, and respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough and hemoptysis. 
Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting parasite eggs in the sputum, pleural fluid, or feces; in addition, larvae can often be found at bronchial brushing. Intradermal and serologic tests are also available. Tuberculosis is the main alternative in the differential diagnosis.
Radiologic findings correlate well with the stage of the disease. The penetration of juvenile worms through the diaphragm into the pleural cavity can cause pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Once the parasites get to the lung, patchy airspace consolidation can occur, a phenomenon that reflects the presence of an exudative or hemorrhagic pneumonia which can cavitate. Contrast material–enhanced CT performed during this stage may show hypoattenuating fluid-filled cysts surrounded by hyperattenuating consolidation in the adjacent lung. Linear areas of increased opacity or hyperattenuation indicate peripheral atelectasis or worm migration. Worm cysts, whose diameters range from 0.5 to 1.5 cm, are better visualized after the consolidation resolves and manifest as either solitary or multiple nodules or gas-filled cysts depending on their content and their communication with the airway. Chest radiographic and CT findings include a ring shadow usually less than 3 mm thick and a crescent-shaped area of increased opacity or hyperattenuation within the cyst that represents worms attached to the wall.

IMT is synonymous with inflammatory pseudotumor, plasma cell granuloma, xanthogranuloma, and fibrous histiocytoma. Histopathologically, it is reported that spindle cells in the tumor commonly have low cellular atypia and no mitotic activity. Based on these histopathological features, IMT could be regarded as a low-grade malignant neoplasm.

The patient underwent renal biopsy and pathologic result was ANCA (pauci-immune) associated focal necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. Also C-ANCA test was positive. ","ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis (Wegener granulomatosis) is an uncommon necrotizing vasculitis affecting multiple organ systems. Classical manifestation is a clinical triad consisting of upper airway (almost 100%) and lower airway involvement (90%) and renal involvement (80%) although it may involve any part of the body. Patient symptom varies and depends on the organ system affected. Patients with pulmonary involvement often complain of cough with or without hemoptysis, dyspnea, fever, and chest pain. Elevation of serum cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) titers, usually directed toward proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase, occurs in up to 90% of patients with active ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis.
Pulmonary nodules and masses are the most common CT findings of ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis and are seen in up to 70% of patients. Waxing and waning of the single or multiple pulmonary nodules and masses with random distribution are features of the disease. Central cavitation occurs in up to 50% of cases and most noncavitated nodules or masses show central low attenuation reflecting extensive central necrosis. CT halo sign (up to 15%) or reverse halo sign, radiating linear scarring, and pleural tags can be ancillary findings. Diffuse ground-glass opacity and consolidation (50%) may result from pulmonary hemorrhage or infection and bilateral perihilar and peribronchovascular distributions are the most common. 
The tracheobronchial tree is the second most commonly affected area in the thorax (16-23% of cases) and subglottic portion of the trachea is most often common location. Segmental, focal, circumferential wall thickening involving the posterior membrane of the trachea is the typical radiologic findings. Pleural involvement (12-20% of the patient) causing pleural effusion and pleuritis and cardiac involvement as a form of pericarditis, coronary arteritis and myocardial ischemia owing to the vasculitis in small to medium-sized coronary artery could be also presented. 
Without treatment, approximately 90% of patients with ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis die within 2 years of diagnosis. Aggressive immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide is the best current therapy (remission rate; 87%). In April 2011, the FDA approved rituximab (a chimeric antibody to CD20 protein) in combination with steroids to treat patients with ANCA-associated granulomatous, but relapse is still common.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-986-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-986-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-986-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-986-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-986-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-986-6.jpg']",72,"['correct:54/72', 'diff:9/72']"

","The invasive form of pulmonary aspergillosis occurs frequently in immunocompromised patients and angioinvasive aspergillosis is the most common form. Histologically angioinvasive aspergillosis is characterized by invasion and occlusion of small to medium-sized pulmonary arteries by fungal hyphae, with formation of coagulative necrosis, alveolar hemorrahge or hemorrhagic infarcts. Clinical manifestations are non-specific, but typical symtoms include cough, fever and dyspnea. 
Typical CT findings are nodules surrounded by a halo of ground glass attenuation or pleura based, wedge shaped consolidations. The halo sign is characterized as aspergillosis infected lung nodule with infarction and coagulative necrosis surrounded by alveolar hemorrhage. Eventually cavitation may occur and separation of central necrotic lung from surrounding lung parenchyma forming an air crescent can be observed.
The halo sign has been identified as an early indicator of invasive aspergillosis. Although non-pathognomonic and identified in a number of other conditions, the CT halo sign is highly suggestive of angioinvasive aspergillosis  when detected in immunocompromised patients. The air crescent sign appears lately in the phase of infection resolution, coinciding with the improvement of neutropenia. The air crescent sign is observed in a later stage of disease, typically 2-3 weeks after initiation of treatment and reported as an indication of good prognosis.

Bone scan with technetium 99m methylene diphosphonate (Tc99m-MDP) (Figs 4) shows increased uptake in the sternum, right clavicle and ribs.	","Sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (SCCH) is a chronic inflammatory disorder which presents with erythema, swelling, and pain of the sternoclavicular joint. Approximately one half of patients have acne or pustular lesions with the best described association being with palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). Extrasternal articular disease occurs in about a quarter of patients. The inflammatory process spans several years and has periods of exacerbation followed by remission. The histologic picture demonstrates a sterile osteomyelitis of the sternum and medial end of the clavicle. 
The major radiographic abnormalities of sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis are seen in the anterior and upper portion of the chest wall. Hyperostosis of the sternum, clavicle, and upper ribs is encountered. Additional changes occur in the vertebral column and include spinal outgrowths that resemble those of ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, or psoriatic spondylitis. The focal uptake of radiopharmaceutical on bone scintigraphy called the ‘bullhead’ sign is highly sensitive of SCCH. 
Treatment is aimed at easing pain and modifying the inflammatory process. Evidence over the last two decades suggests a role for intravenous bisphosphonates and tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors. Untreated chronic inflammation of the sternoclavicular joint leads to restricted mobility and secondary degenerative joint changes. Greater awareness of SCCH is needed to prevent the irreversible physical and psychological impairments associated with the disease.

On CT, multiple tiny or small nodules were located in the left upper lobe (LUL) and right upper lobe. Most of the nodules were clustered in the LUL. Some of them were round but others showed irregular shape. The largest one measured about 1.5 cm. On PET-CT, multiple nodules in LUL showed considerable FDG uptake, suggesting hyper-metabolic state. 

Wedge resection was performed at the LUL. The pathologic diagnosis was cryptococcosis with chronic granulomatous inflammation (GMS, PAS, D-PAS : positive, AFB: negative)","Cryptococcus neoformans, a ubiquitous encapsulated fungus, is the cause of pulmonary cryptococcosis. Cryptococcal infection usually starts with inhalation of organism from environmental source, which is uncommon in immnocompetent hosts. Radiologic manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis are various and consist of 1) solitary pulmonary nodule or mass, 2) segmental or lobar consolidation, and 3) small nodular or reticulonodular pattern. Zinck et al. reported that pulmonary nodules were the most common CT findings (91%) and associated findings were masses, CT halo sign, and consolidation in 11 patients (7: immunocompromised, 4: immunocompetent). Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, cavitation, mass and consolidation are more common in immunocompromised patients. When pulmonary cryptococcosis appears as multiple nodules in immunocompetent patients, they can mimic hematogeneous metastasis because the lesions show random distribution with peripheral predominance. However, cryptococcal nodules tend to cluster in one or few lobes, just like our case. If the FDG uptake of nodules is low, this finding might support the low possibility of metastasis. However, the range of FDG uptake of cryptococcal nodule is wide, with SUVmax varying from 0.93-11.6.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-989-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-989-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-989-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-989-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-989-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-989-6.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-989-7.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-989-8.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-989-9.jpg']",67,"['correct:17/67', 'diff:16/67']"

The aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta are clearly defined, indicating the anterior location of the mass. CT shows a large well-enhancing soft tissue mediastinal mass arising from the 3rd left anterior rib. Both peripheral, rim-like calcifications and internal, septa-like calcifications are seen in the mass. ","Giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone is an uncommon neoplasm accounting for about 4–5% of all primary bone tumors. GCT are generally considered benign but malignant cells can arise either de novo or via malign transformation. GCT's are more common in females [1-4]. Only few cases of GCT involving the ribs have been reported in the literature with most of them involving the posterior aspect. Due to its rarity, GCT arising from the chest wall is difficult to diagnose, particularly when the tumor is located in the anterior rib [1]. Cytologic differential diagnosis includes aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC), brown tumor, chondroblastoma, chondromyxoid fibroma (CMF), non-ossifying fibroma (NOF), giant cell rich osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma [1].
On radiographs, GCT of the rib manifests as a lytic lesion that may be eccentric and has well-defined, non-sclerotic margins. The lesion may cause cortical thinning, or, as in the current case, breakthrough and bone expansion [5,6]. CT may show osseous lysis caused by the tumor. Although matrix calcification is rare, peripheral calcifications, internal septa (which can also be calcified), and cystic components have been described [7-10]. Disruption of the cortex and extension in the soft tissue can also be appreciated on CT.

Surgical specimens of right middle lobe, mediastinal LN, and gallbladder show necrotizing vasculitis with eosinophils, consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome.
","Churg-Strauss syndrome, which is known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and allergic granulomatous angiitis, is a highly variable illness. Some people have only mild symptoms, whereas others experience severe complications. Almost all patients have asthma and eosinophilia but someone also have extrapulmonary signs and symptoms.
There are no specific tests to confirm Churg-Strauss syndrome.  Thus the American College of Rheumatology has established criteria for identifying Churg-Struass syndrome. The following features are consistent with a diagnosis of CSS.
- asthma
- eosinophilia of 10% white blood cell count
- migratory or transient pulmonary opacities on chest radiographs
- mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy
- paranasal sius abnormalities
- extravascular eosinophils on biopsy
 Radiologic manifestations of CSS are nonspecific but may show transient, patchy, and nonsegmental consolidation or small and large nodular opacities. Ground-glass opacities and consolidation seen on high-resolution CT reflect the presence of eosinophilic pneumonia, vasculitis, and pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage. Centrilobular nodules and bronchial wall thickening also can be seen but less common features.
 Treatment for Churg–Strauss syndrome includes glucocorticoids (such as prednisolone) and other immunosuppressive drugs. CSS has no cure but these treatment can usually help control symptoms.

Axial CT images depict a pleural-based polygonal shape consolidation with central lucencies. Enhanced CT was not performed because the patient had an increased BUN. Follow-up d-dimer test, perfusion scan, and clinical course confirmed acute pulmonary infarction.","The patient was diagnosed as drug induced nephrotic syndrome. Patients with nephrotic syndrome are at an increased risk for thrombotic events, such as pulmonary thromboembolism. Increased platelet activation, enhanced red blood cell aggregation, and an imbalance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors are thought to underlie the excessive thrombotic risk.
Pulmonary thromboembolism is the most common cause of pulmonary infarction. Less than 15% of emboli cause true pulmonary infarction. On pathologic study, pulmonary infarction is characterized by ischemic necrosis of alveolar walls, bronchioles, and blood vessels within an area of hemorrhage. Most infarcts occur in the lower lobes, and the majority is multiple. Usually they are roughly cone-shaped areas of hemorrhage and edema that point toward the hilum and are based on the pleura and accompanied by a small pleural effusion. Presence of central lucencies had 98% specificity and 46% sensitivity for pulmonary infarction. When the vessel sign and negative air bronchogram were combined with central lucencies, specificity was increased to 99%. 
Following infarction, fibrous replacement converts the infarct into a contracted scar, with indrawing of the pleura. Local hemorrhage may be the dominant finding with no evidence of tissue necrosis. These lesions resolve without residual scar formation when the consolidation is the result of pulmonary hemorrhage without true infarction. Radiographic clearing of pulmonary hemorrhage occurs quickly, often within a week, whereas infarction takes several months to resolve and frequently leaves permanent linear scars. By 3 months, infarct shadows either are totally resolved or show no more than linear scarring or pleural thickening. As infarcts resolve, they tend to ‘melt away like an ice cube’ whereas acute pneumonia disappears in a patchy fashion.

Early stage of the disease is characterized by the abundance of nodules and cavitated nodules, whereas cysts are few and do not tend to be confluent. The differential diagnosis of early stage of this disease includes pulmonary papillomatosis and cavitary metastasis. 
Advanced disease is characterized by a small number of nodules, whereas cysts have increased in number and size and are confluent. The following sequence of abnormalities seen with CT corresponds to the evolution of the disease; nodules, cavitated nodules, thick-walled cysts, cysts, and confluent cysts, rupture or collapse of cysts with or without pneumothorax. Although many cysts appear round, they can also have bizarre shapes, being bilobed, clover-leaf shaped, or branching in appearance.

Anatomical abnormalities at the thoracic outlet and repetitive trauma to the endothelium of the subclavian vein are key factors in its initiation and progression.
Paget-Schroetter Syndrome is more common in young and otherwise healthy men. It preferentially involves the dominant arm. Swelling and arm discomfort are the most frequent presenting problems. Other symptoms include heaviness, redness of arm, cyanosis and dilated, visible veins across the shoulder and upper arm. Symptom onset is usually acute or sub-acute but an occasional patient can present with chronic symptoms. Not infrequently, symptoms can be nonspecific and can even mimic a muscular strain. Complications include pulmonary embolism, post-thrombotic syndrome and recurrent thrombosis.
Contemporary management of Paget-Schroetter Syndrome varies widely, and there is no broad consensus as to what constitutes the best approach. Conservative therapy is limb elevation and anticoagulation alone. Aggressive treatment strategies involve thrombolysis, thrombectomy, percutaneous and surgical venoplasty, venous bypass and stents.

  On MRI, the mass exhibited high-signal intensity and the mural solid component within the mass exhibited intermediate to low-signal intensity on T2-weighted sequence with fat saturation. After contrast administration, the solid component showed enhancement. On axial diffusion weighted MR images obtained using a b value of 700 sec/mm2, both the cystic and solid components of the mass showed areas of high-signal intensity. However, the ADC value of the solid component was low (dark on the ADC map), suggesting diffusion-restriction.
  Mediastinal mass excision was performed and pathology revealed cystic thymoma, WHO type B1.
","Cystic thymoma is a variant of thymoma, characterized by a predominantly cystic component with an associated mural solid component. Although cystic lesions have been reported to be present in up to 40% of thymomas, those that are nearly entirely cystic are very rare. Cystic thymoma is mostly fluid owing to internal necrosis and cystic degeneration, and is often associated with solid intramural nodules. Foci of hemorrhage may also be present. It is a variant that was not accounted for by the 2004 WHO classification of thymic epithelial tumors. 
  CT can provide information on the precise anatomical location of this lesion as well as its relationship with surrounding structures in addition to its attenuation characteristics. Cystic thymomas appear as solitary round or ovoid masses with smooth or lobulated margins containing a large fluid component in the anterior mediastinum. On MRI, cystic changes and intratumoral necrosis manifest as areas of low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. To the contrary, fibrous septa within the tumor and associated nodularity can be seen as low-signal-intensity areas showing enhancement after contrast administration. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can also help evaluate the tissue composition in mediastinal masses as the nodular soft tissue component shows persistent high signal intensity on high-b-value DWI and a low ADC value, suggesting a lower chance of it being a true cyst.
  Differential Diagnoses include cystic germ cell tumor, cystic lymphoma, cystic teratoma, cystic lymphangioma, and congenital cysts such as bronchogenic or pericardial cysts. The location of the mass and information obtained from CT and MRI can be of great help in terms of mass characterization.

Necrotic fluid as well as two gas-filled cysts can also be seen in anterior segment of the RUL with surrounding subtle GGA (ground glass attenuation).","Human paragonimiasis is caused by the trematode Paragonimus westermani or other Paragonimus species through the ingestion of raw or partially cooked freshwater crabs or crayfish infected with metacercaria. Main endemic areas of this disease are East Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America (primarily Peru), and Africa (primarily Nigeria). The lung is the target organ, although cutaneous and cerebral paragonimiasis have also been described. Patients with disease present with fever, chest pain, and respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough and hemoptysis. Diagnosis is confirmed through the detection of parasite eggs in the sputum, pleural fluid, or feces. In addition, the larvae can often be found via bronchial brushing. Intradermal and serologic tests are also available. 
Radiologic findings correlate well with the stage of the disease, i.e., the penetration of juvenile worms through the diaphragm into the pleural cavity can cause pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Once the parasites reach the lung, patchy airspace consolidations can be observed, a phenomenon that reflects the presence of exudative or hemorrhagic pneumonia which can cavitate. Contrast–enhanced CT performed during this stage may show hypoattenuating fluid-filled cysts surrounded by hyperattenuating consolidation in the adjacent lung. Linear areas of increased opacity or hyperattenuation indicate peripheral atelectasis or worm migration. Worm cysts, whose diameters range from 0.5 to 1.5 cm, are better visualized after the consolidation resolves and manifest as either solitary or multiple nodules or gas-filled cysts depending on their content and their communication with the airway. Chest radiographic and CT findings include a ring shadow usually less than 3 mm thick and a crescent-shaped area of increased opacity or hyperattenuation within the cyst indicating that the worms have attached to the wall. Complications of cysts include pleural effusion, empyema, and pneumothorax.

DNA analysis of the patient revealed a heterozygosis mutation in exon 4 of the FLCN gene, which encodes the protein, folliculin. The patient was finally diagnosed as having Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome. ","Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by mutation of the folliculin (FLCN) gene located in chromosome 17p11.2 which is expressed in stromal cells and type 1 pneumocytes. BHD syndrome manifests as cutaneous lesions, renal tumors or spontaneous pneumothorax. This disease was described by Birt and colleagues in 1977 as a familial dermatological disorder. Fibrofolliculoma is known as the most characteristic finding of BHD, with lung cysts noted in 77-89% of patients with BHD syndrome. Spontaneous pneumothorax owing to lung involvement has been reported in 33-38% of cases, most commonly occurring between 20-40 years of age.
  Radiologically, BHD syndrome presents as bilateral cysts with lower lung predominance (87%). The cysts are irregular in shape, usually round and oval, and the cyst walls are observed to be thin and uniform. No nodules, ground-glass opacities, or signs of honeycombing are noted in this disease.
  Differential diagnoses of cystic lung diseases include lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis may be associated with angiomyolipoma, however, they would also show diffuse uniform thin-walled cysts. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is usually presented in smokers, and early centrilobular nodules sparing the costophrenic angles are characteristic findings. Perivascular cysts in lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia can be found in combination with ground-glass opacities, and may be associated with Sjögren's syndrome or lymphoproliferative disorders.
  Dermatologic examination of the skin lesions and familial history may be helpful in differentiating BHD syndrome from other cystic lung diseases. This diagnosis is difficult to make radiologically, thus genetic confirmation to identify gene mutations may be warranted. In conclusion, the possibility of BHD should be kept in mind when we encounter cystic lung disease.

Median age at presentation is 65 years (age range, 19–80 years), with an even sex distribution. NLH is typically asymptomatic and is found incidentally on imaging studies. NLH is characterized by a dense nodular infiltration of mature, polyclonal lymphocytes and plasma cells with multiple reactive germinal centers, sharply demarcated from the surrounding parenchyma, with central areas of scarring. Mild, local lymphangitic spread of lymphocytes may also be present, permeating into the perivascular interstitium. NLH has been described most commonly as a solitary lesion, although multiple pulmonary nodules can also be observed. It can also manifest with focal consolidation and may regress or remain stable for years. The incidence of NLH is rare whereas MALT lymphoma is relatively common.

","VATS mass excision, posterior mediastinum; lymphangioma
Similar to cystic hygromas, mediastinal lymphangiomas are congenital anomalies that are usually identified in the perinatal period or in childhood. Mediastinal lymphangiomas are sometimes related to cystic lymphangiectasis of the lung, which is frequently a fatal condition for neonates. Unlike cystic lymphangiectasis, the cyst walls of lymphangiomas are thicker and more fibrous. Adult lymphangiomas rarely affect the pulmonary parenchyma and lymphangiomas involving both the lung and the mediastinum have rarely been described.
Lymphangiomas are focal proliferations of lymphatic tissue in which cystic spaces are filled with proteinaceous fluid. They are frequently detected incidentally on chest radiographs. Although CT can provide helpful information regarding the site and size of the lesion, it cannot conclusively make a diagnosis of lymphangioma. Thus, diagnosis is made using histopathologic examinations and MRI is considered the diagnostic modality of choice for lymphangiomas as it can predict subsequent intraoperative findings.

"," Unilateral lung hypoplasia can be primary (idiopathic) or due to secondary causes such as reduced hemithoracic volume, reduced pulmonary perfusion, or reduced fetal respiratory movement (1). Unilateral lung hypoplasia can clinically remain silent until adulthood and is often diagnosed incidentally for non-specific chest complaints (2). Radiological findings in these cases are a marked decrease in the hemithorax with an ipsilateral mediastinal shift and compensatory hyperinflation of the contralateral lung.

","Coccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Coccidioides Immitis via the inhalation of fungal arthrospores. A peculiar geographic distribution has been reported for this illness, occurring mostly in individuals from semi-arid areas with similar weather and soil conditions such as the Southwestern United States (California, Arizona and Texas), Mexico, Central America (Guatemala and Honduras) and South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina).
In Korea, the 1st imported case was reported in 1976, with about 30 cases having been reported domestically thus far. Interestingly, in 3 of these cases, the patients had no travel history and they had lived only in Korea. This suggests the possibility of the naturalization of the Coccidioides species in Korea.
  Sixty percent of patients show no symptoms. Therefore, the definite diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis is made through the demonstration of this organism by culture or histology.
  On imaging, Coccidioidomycosis can be seen as solitary or multifocal consolidations, or nodules which may cavitate. Approximately one-fifth of cases can be seen with hilar lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion. These lesions can be disseminated to nearly any tissue. For differential diagnosis, bacterial or fungal pneumonia, as well as lung cancer should be considered.

Reported incidences of varicella-zoster pneumonia have varied from less than 5% to up to 50% of all cases of varicella infection in adults. More than 90% of cases of varicella-zoster pneumonia occur in adults, in patients with lymphoma, and in those who are immunocompromised for a variety of reasons.
Symptoms of pneumonia develop within a few days after the skin rash appears and include cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, cyanosis, and fever. Analysis of case series suggests that mortality due to varicella pneumonia has declined with the advent of acyclovir, although it remains as high as 22% in immunocompromised hosts.
The diagnosis of varicella-zoster pneumonia rests on the finding of new pulmonary infiltrates in the context of active chickenpox infection. Alternative causes for pulmonary infiltrates should be sought and excluded. The finding of viral inclusion bodies on histology provides strong supporting evidence for the diagnosis of varicella-zoster pneumonia.
Chest radiography findings in varicella-zoster pneumonia are well described and include pulmonary nodules, consolidation, hilar lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusions. Chest CT findings previously described as the development of multiple 5- to 10-mm ill-defined nodules that may be confluent and may come and go in different areas of the lungs.  The small, round consolidations usually resolve within a week after the disappearance of the skin lesions, but they can persist for months. 
There is a report of CT findings of varicella pneumonia that developed as the consequence of primary varicella infection occurring in a double lung transplant recipient, and the CT findings were marked mediastinal lymphadenopathy and interlobular septal thickening which are previously undescribed in varicella pneumonia. These differences may be a peculiarity of varicella pneumonia occurring in transplanted lungs. However, the CT characteristics of varicella pneumonia have been infrequently described; thus, it is probable that many of the features seen in this case may also be observed in non-immunosuppressed, non-lung transplantation patients.

The patient was treated with antibiotics, and follow-up chest PA taken one month later shows a near-complete regression of the previously seen increased opacities in the right upper and lower lung fields, leaving fibrotic scars behind. 

","Round pneumonia, which can mimic solitary pulmonary nodules, comprises less than 1 % of all “coin lesions” and was first reported in the radiology literature in 1954. It is usually described in children but occasionally can be seen in adults as well. In the presence of a pulmonary nodule, round pneumonia should be suspected, particularly if no previous images are available, a rapid growth is observed, or there are signs of infection. The main differential diagnosis is lung cancer, but biopsy should be reserved for lesions that persist despite adequate medical treatment. 
  Patients present with varying degrees of symptoms, from acute or subacute symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia to no symptoms. The most common pathogen is known to be Streptococcus pneumoniae. 

  On chest radiograph, a rounded lesion is noted; air bronchograms may be present, but only in approximately 17% of cases. Recent chest scans are often helpful; 2-3 cm lesions that appeared in the last 2-6 weeks are more likely to be infectious rather than neoplastic.

  On CT, heterogeneous mass of soft-tissue attenuation, possibly with a spiculated margin, air bronchograms, pleural thickening, or satellite lesions, may be seen.

","Thymic enlargement is seen in 30–56% of patients with intrathoracic involvement at presentation. However, Hodgkin disease involving only the thymus is rare. 
Patients with thymic involvement are younger (second to third decades of life) than those without enlargement. Most of the series showed male predominance. 
  Thymic lymphoma appears as a discrete or lobulated mass with typically homogeneous low attenuation. However, it can sometimes appear heterogeneous secondary to necrosis, hemorrhage, or cystic changes. The two morphologic criteria that can suggest the presence of an enlarged thymus are a triangular configuration of the mass or the presence of cysts. 
Involvement of the lung parenchyma is relatively rare. In cases of unilateral hilar adenopathy, parenchymal involvement (if present) is seen in the ipsilateral lung.
The most common feature of primary pulmonary Hodgkin disease is the direct extension from hilar nodes toward the lung. The second most common feature is peripheral nodules with or without cavitation. There is a predilection for the upper lobes. 
Radiologic patterns also include mass or mass-like consolidations and atelectasis of a lobe or segment. This may be due to bronchial compression by the nodes or to endobronchial disease. 
On histologic study, nodular sclerosing Hodgkin disease is characterized by microscopic nodularity. Identification of Reed–Sternberg cells confirms the diagnosis.

Various different sites may be involved such as the dermis, soft tissues, bone and viscera.
•	Bony involvement of the lymphangiomatosis may give an additional differential diagnosis of Gorham’s disease. These two conditions are understood as a spectrum of the lymphangiomatosis process, rather than a separate disease entity. 
•	Due to the non-malignant proliferation of vascular or lymphatic vessels within the bone,  Gorham’s disease leads to resorption and replacement of the involved bone by fibrovascular connective tissue. Thus, it is also known as idiopathic massive osteolysis, phantom bone disease or disappearing bone disease. 
•	Gorham’s  disease may occur at any age, but is most frequently recognized in children and young adults, with no sex predilection or inheritance pattern. The clinical presentation may be variable, depending on the site of involvement, but usually involves pain, fracture and extremity weakness. Radiological investigation is needed for initial diagnosis, continued management and long-term follow-up.
•	Bone lesions in Gorham’s disease occurs in majority of patients and usually involves maxillofacial, upper extremity and trunk. First, it appears as an intramedullary and subcortical radiolucent foci which eventually leads to concentric shrinkage and tapering in tubular bones. More progressed disease shows cortical erosion along with local invasion of angiomatous mass into the adjacent soft tissue, which results in disappearance of remaining bone and progression of osteolytic process to multiple contiguous bones.
•	Bone involvement in Gorham’s disease should be differentiated with local or systemic conditions associated with bone and cartilage destruction, such as metastatic tumor, hyper-parathyroidism, gout or pseudarthrosis. 
•	Thoracic involvement of the Gorham’s disease includes widespread involvement of the skeleton, lymphangioma, chylothorax and rarely, lung parenchymal abnormalities such as diffuse interstitial marking or edema. 
•	Chylothorax is due to invasion of the thoracic duct or penetration of the pleural cavity by dysplastic lymphatic vessels. It may be recurrent and even fatal when bilateral. 
•	Mediastinal lymphangioma associated with Gorham’s disease is rare, but may appear as a well-defined, homogenously low attenuated mass with no mass effect.

Percutaneous needle aspiration biopsy was performed at the LUL. The pathologic diagnosis was cryptococcosis with chronic granulomatous inflammation (GMS, PAS: positive)
","Cyptococcus neoformans is a thin-walled, nonmycelial, budding encapsulated yeast. It is found worldwide, particularly in soil contaminated with pigeon excreta and decayed wood . Human infection occurs via inhalation of cryptococcal particles into the lungs, although pneumonia is relatively uncommon in infected individuals.
Cryptococcal infections most commonly occur in immunocompromised hosts, such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, transplant-related immunosuppression, or hematologic malignancies. Immunocompetent individuals are infected less commonly.
According to Khoury et al. who compared the chest radiographic findings of immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, they found a wider variety of radiographic abnormalities among immunocompromised patients. Specifically, areas of consolidation, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusions occurred only in the immunocompromised patients. In addition, Sider and Westcott examined the CT scans of 10 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and pulmonary cryptococcosis and reported parenchymal opacities (n = 7), interstitial opacities (n = 5), segmental alveolar opacities (n = 5), multiple ill-defined spiculated nodules (n = 3), lymphadenopathy (n = 1), and small bilateral pleural effusions (n = 1). They found that patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome had a lower incidence of nodules (three of 10 vs nine of 10 in their study) and a higher incidence of other pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities than did their immunocompetent patients. 
Lacomis et al. also reported a wider variety of imaging findings and a lower incidence of pulmonary nodules in 46 patients, only one of whom was immunocompetent. The most common finding in their study was an area of consolidation (n = 30). 
Recently, Xie et al. reported a comparison of CT findings in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. In their report, pulmonary nodules/masses, either solitary or multiple, were the most common CT finding; associated findings included CT halo signs (n = 24), cavitations (n = 23), and air bronchograms (n = 17). Areas of consolidation (n = 14), areas of GGO (n = 13), linear opacities (n = 11), lymphadenopathies (n = 5), and pleural effusions (n = 8) were uncommon. The parenchymal abnormalities were peripherally located in 47 (65.2%) cases. Cavitations within nodules/masses were more frequently present in immunocompromised patients than in immunocompetent patients, and in AIDS patients than in non-AIDS immunocompromised patients. Air bronchograms within nodules/masses were more frequently present in immunocompetent patients than in immunocompromised patients. Nodules/masses with halo signs were less frequent in AIDS patients than in non-AIDS immunocompromised patients.

Several small sized lymphadenopathies in the mediastinum and hilum are noted. Splenomegaly is also identified (not shown).
CT-guided needle biopsy and additional VATS biopsy at the RML lateral segment were done. The biopsy result was confirmed as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
","Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is the most common type of lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common type of NHL. In this case, we identified both pulmonary lesions and splenomegaly. Thus, secondary pulmonary lymphoma was suggested. Primary pulmonary lymphoma is limited to the lung with or without mediastinal LNs and there is no evidence of extrathoracic dissemination for at least 3 months after the initial diagnosis.

  Pulmonary involvement is identified more often in HL than in NHL, and the lung is more frequently involved in disseminated or recurrent disease than in primary disease. Pulmonary parenchymal involvement may present with variable patterns. The most common feature of pulmonary involvement is the direct extension of hilar or mediastinal nodes toward the lungs; however, recurrences in the lung may be seen without associated lymphadenopathy. Other appearances include pulmonary nodules (with or without cavitation), lobar or segmental consolidation with air bronchograms representing peribronchial tumor infiltration without destruction of the bronchial wall, a reticular pattern with a bronchovascular bundle and interlobular septal thickening, disseminated small nodules, cavitating masses, endobronchial lesions, and atelectasis or obstructive pneumonia secondary to endobronchial or nodal obstruction. When these findings are seen in a patient with newly diagnosed lymphoma, pulmonary involvement of lymphoma should be considered. In treated patients, however, it is often difficult to differentiate pulmonary involvement from other benign conditions such as infection, radiation pneumonia, or drug-induced lung disease. Thus, it is important to determine whether the tumor originated from the lung parenchyma (primary pulmonary lymphoma), whether it originated in nodal tissue with direct spread to the adjacent lung, or whether it originated in nodal tissue and hematogenously spread to extranodal sites.

  When we identify pulmonary consolidations and nodules, radiologists must not forget to consider lymphoma as a possible differential diagnosis

There were no surrounding satellite nodules, other lung parenchymal changes, or enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. On PET-CT, the lesion showed high FDG uptake (max. SUV: 7.8) and there were no other lesions showing significant uptake. Malignancies such as pleural metastasis or other primary malignancy was suggested. However, VATS pleural biopsy revealed that the lesion was a ‘Chronic granulomatous inflammation, consistent with tuberculosis’. Thus, the patient was started on TB medication and the mass finally disappeared.","Although pulmonary tuberculosis is usually accompanied by parenchymal abnormalities, pleural effusion or a pleural nodule/mass may be the sole imaging manifestation of tuberculosis (TB). Pleural TB may occur by extension from lymphatics. 
  In a previous study, experimental findings suggested the implication of interleukin (IL)10 in the reactivation of TB. Indeed, serum IL10 concentrations have been proven to be increased in NHL patients which could lead to compromised cell mediated immunity and reactivation of latent TB. Thereafter, several cases have been reported of pleural TB without parenchymal involvement or lymphadenopathy.
  Although FDG is a cancer specific imaging agent, false positive results may be observed with benign disease and are commonly observed in areas of active inflammation or infection. Tuberculosis usually presents in the lungs, but in one third of cases, it may present in other organs such as lymph nodes, pulmonary pleura, the genitourinary system, skeletal system, pericardium, and the central nerveous system. Although a high SUV, greater than 2.5, is attributed to malignant lesions, people have encountered high values of peak SUV, even up to 21.0, in tuberculous lesions. Unlike 18F-FDG PET scans, 11C-choline PET scans can help differentiate between lung cancer and tuberculoma as the standard uptake value of tuberculoma is low in 11C-choline PET scans.

The patient had asthma, eosinophilia greater than 10% of the white blood cell differential count (10.8%), migratory or transient pulmonary opacities, and paranasal sinus abnormalities; the diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome was made.
  He was administered steroid pulse therapy. Follow-up chest CT scan showed markedly decreased extent of previous lesions but a newly developed focal consolidation in the RLL. Last follow-up chest PA, obtained 5 months later, revealed marked improvement of the previous consolidation, nodular opacities, and linear opacities.
","Churg–Strauss syndrome (allergic angiitis and granulomatosis) is a rare vasculitis of unknown etiology defined by the 1994 International Consensus Conference as an ‘‘eosinophil-rich, granulomatous inflammation involving the respiratory tract and necrotizing vasculitis affecting small to medium sized vessels, with associated asthma and eosinophilia.’’
  The most typical clinical presentation of Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is the appearance of vasculitic manifestations in patients with known allergic rhinitis, sinus polyposis, and late onset asthma, usually preexisting for 5-10 years. General symptoms (i.e., fever or weight loss), mononeuritis multiplex, and/or necrotic cutaneous purpura are the most frequent manifestations at disease onset, in combination with elevated blood eosinophilia and inflammatory syndrome.
 The diagnosis of CSS can be made if four or more of the following six findings are present: asthma, eosinophilia greater than 10% of the white blood cell differential count, neuropathy, migratory or transient pulmonary opacities, paranasal sinus abnormalities, and extravascular eosinophils revealed at biopsy.
 At radiography, CSS usually appears as bilateral nonsegmental consolidations
or reticulonodular opacities.
The most common high-resolution CT manifestations consist of areas of ground-glass attenuation or consolidation in either a patchy or a predominantly peripheral distribution; the areas of consolidation can be transient. Less common abnormalities include small centrilobular nodules and, occasionally, larger nodules measuring 0.5 to 3.5 cm in diameter. Unilateral or bilateral pleural effusions are seen in approximately 30% of patients, and hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy in a small number of cases.
 The primary therapy for CSS is systemic glucocorticoids. An additional immunosuppressive agent is typically added in patients with more advanced or refractory disease and in those whose disease flares with tapering of systemic glucocorticoids.

Chest CT shows multiple, thin-walled, round cysts and relatively well-defined pulmonary nodules in both lungs. Some cysts contain small pulmonary nodules and some nodules contain amorphous calcifications.","Amyloidosis is a systemic disease caused by extracellular accumulation of amyloid substances. Amyloid deposition can occur in the lung in the setting of primary or secondary systemic diseases. It appears in the lung in 30%–90% of primary systemic amyloidosis cases, and secondary amyloidosis can occur with a host of chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g., collagen disease such as RA). Three histopathologic types of pulmonary amyloidosis are present: submucosal tracheobronchial deposits, diffuse interstitial deposits, and single or multiple pulmonary nodules. 
  Nodular amyloidosis is almost always localized to the lungs. The nodules usually are concentrated in the lower lobes and are typically subpleural or in the peripheral space. They vary in shape and size (range, 0.5–15.0 cm). Calcification or ossification is seen in up to 50% of cases. In rare instances, nodular amyloid deposits may be associated with cysts, but their relationship is unclear. Nodular amyloidosis associated with thin-walled cysts is most common in patients with Sjogren syndrome.

Since pulmonary carcinoma is rare in children, primary diagnostic consideration is given to respiratory tract infections and is empirically treated; hence, carcinomas are detected late.
Mucoepidermoid carcinoma commonly presents with cough, hemoptysis, wheezing, chest pain, fever and sometimes clubbing of fingers. In a child with recurrent pneumonia or hemoptysis, mucoepidormoid carcinoma should be considered among the differential diagnoses and imaging with radiograph and CT should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

","AEP represents a clinical entity that is distinct from other idiopathic eosinophilic lung diseases. Diagnostic criteria include acute febrile illness of less than 5 days, hypoxemia, and diffuse alveolar or mixed alveolar-interstitial opacities on chest radiograph.
Peripheral blood eosinophil percentages are usually normal, although they become elevated during the subsequent clinical course. BAL fluid consists of more than 25% eosinophils.
Patients respond rapidly to high doses of corticosteroids, usually within 24–48 hours. 

The cause of AEP remains unknown; however, AEP-like signs and symptoms have been reported after cigarette smoking or exposure to dust or smoke from fireworks.
The principal histologic finding in AEP is diffuse alveolar damage associated with interstitial and alveolar eosinophilia.
The predominant radiographic findings of AEP are bilateral reticular densities (with or without areas of patchy consolidation) and pleural effusion. The predominant patterns of parenchymal abnormality seen at CT are bilateral patchy areas of ground-glass opacity, frequently accompanied by interlobular septal thickening and sometimes by consolidation or poorly defined nodules.
Radiologic differential diagnoses of AEP include hydrostatic pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome or acute interstitial pneumonia, and atypical bacterial or viral pneumonia. However, as initial peripheral blood eosinophil counts are usually normal, developing a clinicoradiologic differential diagnosis for AEP is often difficult.

The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the lung nodule was 1.2 on FDG PET CT scan. The patient underwent VATS biopsy for diagnosis and the resected nodule was confirmed as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.,"Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EH) is a rare neoplasm of vascular origin with an epithelioid appearance, initially referred to as an intravascular bronchioloalveolar tumor. Being considered as a low- to intermediate-grade sarcoma, the tumor predominantly involves the liver and lungs, and rarely, bones, and can be aggressive and multicentric, even resulting in systemic metastases. 
	Pulmonary EHs are four times more common in women than men and are often detected incidentally, as patients are usually asymptomatic. The tumors have variable prognosis; life expectancy may range from less than one year up to 30 years. There are no established standard treatment of choice. Surgery and/or chemoradiation therapy could be considered depending on intrathoracic tumor spread and systemic metastases.
	There are three different patterns of CT findings of thoracic EHs: multiple pulmonary nodules; multiple pulmonary reticulonodular opacities; and diffuse infiltrative pleural thickening. PET/CT findings have been reported for a few patients with thoracic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EH) with variable increased FDG-uptakes. Because 18-flurine-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is incorporated into rapidly growing, aggressive tumors, 18F-FDG-PET/CT would be valuable for patients with thoracic EHs in the evaluation of the metabolic activity of the multiple pulmonary nodules and in search for other foci of EHs throughout the body. The standardized uptake value (SUV) of EHs on 18F-FDG-PET/CT might also be used as an indicator for therapeutic decision making. However, when deciding surgical resection of small EH nodules less than 2 cm in diameter, it should be considered that the measurement of the SUVs could be of a limited value because of the partial volume averaging effect, which is one of many factors affecting the SUV and would underestimate the real hypermetabolic activity of EH nodules.

Nakatsuka et al. reported that the major computed tomography (CT) finding of PAS is a pleural mass.1 In the description of pleural lymphoma, Kunimasa et al. reported the “thoracic sandwich sign” which appears a large mass encasing the vessel structures.2 In the present case, contrast-enhanced chest CT image shows the patent right intercostal artery within the conglomerated pleural mass representing the “pleural sandwich sign”. So, several studies have suggested that this sign may be useful in the diagnosis of primary pleural lymphoma.2-3 ","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1036-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1036-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1036-3.jpg']",91,"['correct:58/91', 'diff:14/91']"

","Amyloidosis is a disease characterized by the deposition of abnormal proteins in extracellular tissue. Clinically there are three broad classifications of pulmonary involvement: (1) diffuse or alveolar septal, (2) localized nodular, and (3) tracheobronchial amyloidosis. 
Amyloid nodules in the lung parenchyma are usually an incidental finding that need to be distinguished from neoplasia. They are usually peripheral and subpleural, occur more frequently in the lower lobes, may be bilateral, and range in diameter from 0.4 cm to 15 cm.
Rarely, nodular or diffuse pulmonary amyloidosis may present with thin walled cysts. Amyloid–associated cystic lung disease is usually associated with AL amyloidosis and can occur in patients with or without underlying connective tissue disease (especially Sjögren's syndrome).

Lateral chest radiograph shows that the lesion abuts the anterior chest and exhibits a sharply marginated posterior border.
Axial pre- and post-contrast CT images show a heterogeneously enhancing lobular mass in the right anterior hemithorax that forms obtuse angles with the adjacent pleural surfaces. Post-contrast scans demonstrate multiple intratumoral vessels. Coronal scan shows that the mass is attached to the visceral pleura by a vascular pedicle.
The patient underwent CT-guided percutaneous biopsy for the mass. During biopsy procedure, the mass exhibited positional change in both lesion shape and location. At the surgical field for VATS resection, a vascular pedicle attaching to the mass was confirmed. ","Localized fibrous tumor of the pleural (LFTP) is the 2nd most common primary pleural neoplasm accounting for <5% of pleural neoplasm. LFTP occurs in a wide range of patients with a mean age of 50-57 years. Up to 50% of affected patients are asymptomatic, while large tumors may cause cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and discomfort. 
At radiography, LFTP patients may show a well-defined peripheral nodule or mass of variable size which abuts the pleural surface. At CT scans, LFTP appears as a soft tissue nodule or mass with well-defined lobular contours and heterogeneous enhancement. Low attenuation within the mass corresponds to cysts, hemorrhage, and necrosis. Contrast-enhanced CT scans may exhibit visualization of enhancing intratumoral vessels. Although the mass may be large, there is no evidence of local invasion or lymphadenopathy. Best diagnostic clues are a pleural based mass with positional change.
Complete excision is typically curative with favorable prognosis of 5-year survival rates of 97%. 12-37% of LFTP are malignant and may produce distant metastasis. Recurrence occurs in up to 23% of patients with LFTP, more likely with malignant and sessile LFTP.

The patient has undergone a surgical resection of a tumor in the left thigh which was diagnosed with a pleomorphic liposarcoma one year ago. The multiple pulmonary nodules were newly developed on regular follow-up chest radiograph.
","Liposarcoma, representing the single most common type of soft tissue sarcoma, includes three biological types; myxoid (ML), pleomorphic (PL) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL). Pleomorphic liposarcoma (PL) is a high-grade sarcoma showing histological evidence of adipocytic differentiation and represents the rarest variant of liposarcoma.  The PL has a tendency to involve the lungs more than any other organs in their spread, in contrast to ML, which favors extrapulmonary sites. It has shorter interval to pulmonary and extrapulmonary metastasis than other liposarcomas.
The morphologic features of metastatic liposarcoma to the lung seem diverse but usually within the spectrum of the histologic type of the primary tumor. The tumor outline was well circumscribed without infiltrating tumor cells at the periphery, and the protruding nests of tumor cells were covered by reactive alveolar epithelium. The changes were interpreted as a sign of a relatively slower tumor growth, thereby permitting some reaction from surrounding tissue. But the metastatic foci of liposarcoma might differ in histologic features from the primary tumor like other tumors and often are more cellular with fewer lipoblasts or even nonlipogenic. The evaluation of these metastatic tumors is confounded by therapy-related changes precluding the estimation of true cellularity and cytologic appearance of neoplastic cells.

Serial postoperative chest radiographs show a large increased density occupying the right upper and middle lung zones with bulging nature of the lower margin. However, the surgeon thought the increased density as pneumonia due to increased CRP.
Contrast-enhanced chest CT scan was performed 6 days after the operation. At lung window view, there was diffuse ground-glass attenuation and consolidation with increased volume in the RML. At mediastinal window view, abnormal soft-tissue attenuation at superior aspect of the right inferior pulmonary vein, wall thickening along the right middle lobar bronchus, stretching of the pulmonary artery, and acute obliteration of the vein draining from the RML was seen. 
Under the impression of lobar torsion and subsequent infarction, operation was performed. The operator found RML torsion with intact RML bronchus and artery, but narrowing of the RML vein with severe congestion, thus, right middle lobectomy was performed.
","Lung torsion most commonly occurs as a complication of thoracic surgery with reported incidences of 0.1% of pulmonary resection. Majority of lung torsions occur after right upper lobe lobectomy (70%) followed by left upper lobe lobectomy (15%). The middle lobe is particularly vulnerable after upper lobectomy because its small size expands to occupy a potentially large free space.
Radiographic findings consist of reoriented major fissure which may extend below the hilum and rapid postoperative lobar opacification. 
CT findings include tapered obliteration of the proximal pulmonary artery and accompanying bronchus of the involved lobe and amorphous soft-tissue attenuation at the hilum.

As pulmonary manifestation in immunocompetent patients, nodule or mass is the most common form. It is usually small, smoothly marginated, solitary or multiple(more likely bilateral), upper and middle lung predominance, and tends to be distributed peripherally. However, consolidation, cavitation, ground-glass opacity, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion can also be seen. The extent of pulmonary manifestation is also dependent on patients’ immune status.

Intramural low density area is surrounded by peripheral enhancing rim. At the level of aortic arch, a small air bubble is seen inside the thickened esophageal wall. Barium esophagogram shows multiple mucosal defects and extraluminal barium collection along the long axis of esophagus.","Phlegmon is a spreading diffuse inflammatory process associated with the formation of a suppurative exudate or pus. Phlegmonous infection can affect any site of the gastrointestinal tract, although the stomach is most frequently involved. Simultaneous involvement of esophagus and stomach is rare. Phlegmonous infection usually involves the submucosa and not the mucosa; inflammation may involve the muscularis mucosa and the serosa and lead to perforation. Phlegmonous gastritis may be either localized or diffuse. 

The pathogenesis of acute phlegmonous esophagitis is unclear. Reported predisposing factors include immune suppression, alcoholism, peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis or some other gastric mucosal injury, achlorhydria, infection, connective tissue disease, and malignancy. Presumably, these conditions predispose the stomach to infection by eliminating various defense mechanisms, such as inherent gastric cytoprotection or bactericidal effect of gastric acid. Nevertheless, approximately 50% of reported cases were on previously healthy patients with no significant anteceding risk factors.

CT findings of phegmonous esophagitis or gastritis are diffuse esophageal and gastric wall thickening with circumferential intramural low density areas. Area of intramural low attenuation surrounded by a peripherally enhancing rim represents intramural abscess. Air bubbles in the thickened esophageal wall seen on CT may have been produced by gas-forming organisms (indicating emphysematous esophagogastritis) or entered the wall when the intramural abscess spontaneously drained into the lumen.
The radiographic differential diagnoses include dissecting intramural hematoma and tubular duplication of esophagus. However, the clinical symptom of dissecting intramural hematoma is chest pain with no evidence of infection or inflammation, and patients with tubular duplication are unlikely to have symptoms or signs.

Antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage are effective treatments for acute phlegmonous esophagitis depending on the clinical situation. Protracted conservative treatment results in surgical resection due to the possibilities of esophageal necrosis, esophageal stricture, gastric mucosal atrophy, and complicated peritonitis. Therefore, awareness of this disease entity and prompt diagnosis based on typical chest CT findings are major key factors to successful treatment.

ACC has a striking tendency toward submucosal extension and manifests with circumferential and infiltrative growth. The longitudinal extent of the tumor is greater than its transaxial extent. 
Chest radiographs are usually interpreted as normal findings. However, intraluminal filling defect with irregular, smooth, or lobulated contours of the airways can be identified and the extraluminal component may be visualized if it is large enough to distort the normal mediastinal contour. On CT, the tumor has a striking tendency toward submucosal extension that manifests as an intraluminal mass of soft tissue attenuation with extension through the airway wall, a diffuse or circumferential airway wall thickening, a soft tissue mass filling the airway, or a homogeneous mass encircling the airway with wall thickening. On PET-CT scan, variable FDG uptake has been reported depending on the grade of tumor differentiation. Distant metastasis occurs late in the disease course.

","Imaging a patient during a cardiac arrest is not a common occurrence. The imaging findings of sudden cardiac arrest during CT examination have been described in a few case reports only.
CT findings of cardiac arrest include dependent pooling and layering of contrast in the venous system, with faint or no opacification of the left sided cardiac chambers, aorta, and the abdominal organs. Injected contrast is seen layering in lumbar veins, hepatic and renal veins and parenchyma, and within the dependent part of the IVC and the right sided cardiac chambers. These findings can be explained by poor cardiac function, with failure to propel blood against gravity. If the heart stops pumping, the systemic arterial and venous pressures drop significantly, with loss of the arteriovenous pressure gradient. So the distribution of injected contrast material depends on the pressure with which the contrast is injected and the density of the contrast agent. Also the left sided cardiac chambers, aorta, and the abdominal organs are not well opacified by the contrast media.
The radiologist should be aware of the imaging findings so that any further imaging is discontinued and proper resuscitative measures can be taken immediately..

","Castleman disease is a non-clonal lymphoproliferative disorder. It is one of the more common causes of non-neoplastic lymphadenopathy. Two classification systems exist for Castleman disease: the older morphologic classification and the more recent histopathogenetic classification. 
The morphologic classification distinguishes between unicentric and multicentric Castleman disease on the basis of the extent of local lymph node involvement. The histopathogenetic classification distinguishes hyaline vascular type, plasma cell type, human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)–associated Castleman disease, and multicentric Castleman disease not otherwise specified.
The classic CT appearance of hyaline vascular Castleman disease is a solitary enlarged lymph node or localized nodal masses that demonstrates homogeneous intense enhancement after contrast material administration. Three patterns of involvement have been described, including a solitary noninvasive mass (50% of cases), a dominant infiltrative mass with associated lymphadenopathy (40% of cases), and matted lymphadenopathy without a dominant mass (10% of cases).
The multicentric, hyaline vascular variant of Castleman disease has rarely been reported in the literature. Multicentric Castleman disease runs a more aggressive course and can progress to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

PET-CT shows mildly hypermetabolic lesion (SUVmax 2.7) in the left lower lobe and multiple small nodular lesions with mild FDG uptake in both lungs (Fig. 3).

Wedge resection was performed for the lung nodule in left lower lobe, and the pathologic diagnosis was nodular lymphoid hyperplasia.
","Pulmonary nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH) is a benign, localized, reactive polyclonal lymphoproliferative lesion with unclear etiopathogenesis. This term was first suggested in 1983 by Kradin and Mark to describe one or more nodules or localized lung infiltrates consisting of a reactive lymphoid proliferation. The concept of reactive localized masses of lymphoid tissue in lung, also termed “pseudolymphoma”, was initially proposed in 1963 by Saltzstein to explain the low histologic grade, presence of numerous lymphoid follicles, and benign clinical course of most lung lymphoid proliferations.
Little is known about incidence or natural history of pulmonary NLH, as it is a relatively rare entity. The median age at presentation is 65 years (range 19–80 years), with an even sex distribution. NLH is usually asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging studies (70%).
Histopathology of NLH is characterized by a dense nodular infiltration of mature, polyclonal lymphocytes and plasma cells with multiple reactive germinal centres, sharply demarcated from surrounding parenchyma and with central areas of scarring.
The most frequent radiographic finding of NLH is a solitary pulmonary nodule. Multiple lesions have been present in 36% of patients. On chest radiograph, lesions are either discrete nodules or ill-defined nodular opacities. Air-bronchograms are often seen. On multidetector CT, lesions are well-circumscribed nodules (solitary pulmonary nodule or focal consolidation) with average diameter of 2 cm (range 0.6–6 cm). Occasionally, 2–3 nodules coalesce to form a discrete mass and very mild, focal lymphangitic spread may be seen. In many instances, preoperative diagnosis is difficult and surgical confirmation is necessary.

Mediastinal window setting images of non-contrast enhanced chest CT (Fig 3-5) also show dense irregular calcification in the pericardium along both ventricular chambers including the atrioventricular groove. Enlargement of both ventricles is not definite. ,"Constrictive pericarditis is characterized by fibrous or calcified constrictive thickening of the pericardium, which prevents normal diastolic ventricular expansion. There are several causes of constrictive pericarditis including cardiac surgery, radiation therapy, infection (viral or tuberculous), connective tissue disease, and neoplasm. 
Clinically, it is difficult to differentiate between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy because of similar clinical manifestations and similar findings at cardiac catheterization and echocardiography. However, it is important to distinguish between the two different disease entities, because constrictive pericarditis is potentially curable by pericardiectomy.
On chest radiographs, constrictive pericarditis shows calcification in the pericardium in roughly 50% of patients. The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is greatly aided by CT and MR imaging. Normal pericardial thickness (less than 2 mm) on CT and MRI images can exclude constrictive pericarditis even in patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. The CT and MRI image findings of constrictive pericarditis include pericardial thickening (greater than 4 mm), narrowing and tubular deformity of the right ventricle, normal or small ventricular size, and straightening of the interventricular septum. Irregular calcification may be anywhere over the surface of the heart but is particularly present in regions of the heart where the normal fat is abundant (such as in the atrioventricular groove).

	Computed tomography of the chest obtained with contrast enhancement also shows markedly dilated esophagus with air-fluid level.
","Achalasia is defined by esophageal outflow obstruction from abnormal relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) due to deranged inhibitory control. In genetically predisposed individuals, an autoimmune response to an unknown inciting agent, perhaps a viral infection, results in inflammation and sometimes loss of myenteric plexus ganglia and neurons. The net result is varying degrees of inhibitory dysfunction, at times associated with imbalanced and exaggerated excitatory function, with manometrically distinct achalasia phenotypes on high resolution manometry. 
There are several types of achalasia. Type 1 achalasia, with esophageal outflow obstruction and absent esophageal body contractility, is an end-stage phenotype. Type 2 achalasia is characterized by panesophageal compartmentalization of pressure in the untreated patient, and partial recovery of peristalsis after treatment. Esophageal outflow obstruction with premature peristalsis (type 3 achalasia) or intact peristalsis may result from plexitis in the myenteric plexus but can also be encountered in other settings including chronic opioid medication usage and structural processes at the esophagogastric junction and distally. In most instances when idiopathic esophageal outflow obstruction is confirmed, some form of pharmacologic manipulation or disruption of the LES provides durable symptom relief.

VATS biopsy was performed and pathologic diagnosis was multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyerplasia (MMPH). These findings suggest tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) of the patient with MMPH, TS-associated osteosclerotic lesion, and an angiomyolipoma of kidney. ","TSC is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by hamartomatous growth in the skin, eyes, kidneys, and central nervous system. Pulmonary involvement occurs in 1% of cases and usually manifests as lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). MMPH is another, extremely rare pulmonary manifestation of TSC, which was first described by Popper et al. in 1991. MMPH is a hamartomatous process of the lung that exhibits multiple tiny pulmonary nodules. High-resolution CT in MMPH reveals nodules 1–8 mm in diameter that are diffusely scattered throughout the lung in a random distribution with regard to the secondary lobule. Pathologically, the minute pulmonary nodules represent clusters of cuboidal epithelial cells with mild cellular atypia lining thickened alveolar septa. The cell of origin is the type II pneumocyte. 
The presence of multiple tiny pulmonary nodules in a random distribution in a TSC patient should suggest the presence of MMPH. The differential diagnosis should also include a miliary granulomatous infection, Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis (LCH), or hematogenous metastases. MMPH occurs more frequently in patients with TSC than with LAM and rarely presents in patients without TSC or LAM. The clinical manifestations resulting from isolated MMPH are dyspnea, cough, and mild to moderate hypoxemia. The clinical course of MMPH is usually not progressive, and treatment is unnecessary.

The saprophytic aspergillosis in immunocompetent patients accompanied by an air-meniscus sign enables it to be distinguished from malignancy. Pulmonary aspergillosis without air-meniscus sign is seen as a non-specific solid nodule or mass on CT scans.

Moreover, the lung abnormalities donot show rapid resolution even with antifungal therapy. 
The disease in immunocompetent patients may show various patterns of lung lesions; however, A clustered nodular pattern, localized to a lung lobe, is the most common abnormality. Therefore, lung lesions of single or multiple nodules or a mass, for this condition, may persist and may simulate malignant disease, a chronic inflammatory or an infectious disease, or a metastatic lesion, particularly when patients have an underlying extra-thoracic malignancy.
In half of the cases, the disease appeared in patients with underlying disease, in which most of the patients had an extra-thoracic malignant condition. Therefore, when lung lesions show clustered or scattered nodules of an indolent nature, pulmonary cryptococcosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis, even for a patient with an extrathoracic malignancy. Although clinical improvement can be achieved in all patients, radiological improvement is slow, even after antifungal therapy.

This patient underwent excision of the intrapericardial mass with right video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Although analysis of the pericardial fluid was negative for malignancy, the pericardial mass was confirmed as malignant mesothelioma, biphasic type.
","Primary malignant mesothelioma of the pericardium accounts for less than 5% of all mesotheliomas. The etiology of primary malignant pericardial mesothelioma remains unclear. The role of asbestos exposure as a causative factor in the development of pericardial mesothelioma is not well established. Asbestos exposure has been documented only in 14% of the patients. Typically it appears as either multiple pericardial-based nodules with or without a dominant mass, or as a diffuse tumor that encases some portions of the heart. Localized (solitary) pericardial mesothelioma is considered a rare variant of malignant mesothelioma. Three histopathologic types of pericardial mesothelioma have been defined: pure epithelial, sarcomatoid, and mixed (biphasic). 
As the extent of the disease can be evaluated with CT and MR imaging, these modalities offer more advantage over echocardiography. On both CT and MR images, pericardial mesothelioma appears as a heterogeneously enhancing mass that involves both the parietal and visceral layers of the pericardium. The possibility of invasion of the adjacent vascular and anatomic structures should be kept in mind. Localized malignant mesothelioma needs to be differentiated from solitary fibrous tumor of the pericardium, lymphoma, hemangioma, sarcoma, and metastasis. 
Localized malignant mesothelioma is capable of aggressive behavior and carries a poor prognosis, with the length of survival ranging between 6 weeks and 15 months, regardless of therapy. However, in contrast to the diffuse type, complete surgical excision may be curative. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy have a limited role in cases of non-resectable disease.

","Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a distinct sub-entity of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) which was positive for Ki-1. This disease is characterized by the proliferation of pleomorphic large neoplastic lymphoid cells, which strongly express the CD30 antigen (Ki-1 antigen), usually growing in a cohesive pattern and preferentially spreading in the lymph node sinuses.

 Primary ALCL originating from the lung is extremely rare. Its nonspecific radiologic and clinical features make it challenging to diagnose. Radiologic features of ALCL of the lung, includes a solitary mass, multiple pulmonary nodules, bronchovascular bundle and interlobular septal thickening, and endobronchial mass causing atelectasis. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy are often present. Pleural or pericardial effusion is also reported to be frequently associated. Definite diagnosis comes from histopathologic evaluation. Once the ALCL of the lung is confirmed, systemic survey is necessary to identify extra-thoracic organ involvement, such as mesentery, peritoneum, LNs and GI tract.

A few possible mechanisms of air-space development in the tumor are suggested. Proliferation and hyalinization of alveolar mesenchymal cells around the bronchus can lead to airway narrowing and distention of distal air space. Air meniscus may also be induced by disparate rates of contraction between the tumor and the capsule, possibly after tumor hemorrhage or due to communication with airway after peritumoral hemorrhage. Peripheral lung tissue entrapped by the tumor may have resulted in air trapping within the tumor through the communicated bronchioles, and eventually, the air space may have enlarged through both check-valve mechanism and tumor growth.

Some studies suggest that a higher percentage of patients with atypical pulmonary carcinoid tumors is related to smoking. 
It is known that pulmonary carcinoid tumors usually demonstrate marked homogeneous enhancement on enhanced CT. However, some carcinoids may show heterogeneous enhancement or no enhancement. Internal calcification can be seen, but cavitation is rare. In cases of pulmonary carcinoids presenting as a solitary pulmonary nodule with intense enhancement, pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma (sclerosing hemangioma), intrapulmonary Castleman’s disease, metastasis, or primary lung cancer can be considered in the differential diagnosis.
It has long been suggested that carcinoid tumors show low FDG uptake on PET-CT. However, some newer studies have shown variable values of max. SUV,some values as high as 6 or greater.

Non-enhanced (Fig. 2) and enhanced chest CT scan (Fig. 3-5) showed a well-defined, lobulated, inhomogeneously enhancing mass in left side of anterior mediastinum, abutting pulmonary trunk, left main pulmonary artery, left aspect of aortic arch, left upper pulmonary vein. A satellite small well defined nodule was located between left common carotid artery and left brachiocephalic vein (Fig. 6). showed no evidence of lung parenchymal invasion. PET-CT scan showed heterogenous high FDG uptake in the mass lesion (SUVmax: 8.19, Fig. 7).
The patient underwent surgical mass excision (Fig. 8). The final pathological report showed a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the thymus. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for the neuroendocrine markers cytokeratin-Pan, synaptophysin, and CD56 on the immunohistochemical stains.","Primary thymic neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) are relatively rare neoplasms that may account for approximately 2%–4% of all anterior mediastinal neoplasms. NECs were morphologically categorized into four main types: typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and small-cell carcinoma. 
A LCNEC of the thymus is a very rare malignant tumor which has a very poor prognosis. 
There were a few case reports of LCNEC of the thymus. 
A thymic NET typically manifests as a large, lobulated, usually invasive, anterior mediastinal mass with heterogeneous enhancement that may exhibit areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Punctate and dystrophic calcifications may also be seen. There are no pathognomonic findings, and it may be difficult to distinguish a thymic NET from other thymic malignancies or from nonthymic malignancies such as lymphoma or metastatic disease on the basis of radiographic imaging. 
LCNEC was characterized by 1) a light microscopic neuroendocrine appearance, 2) large sized, polygonal-shaped cells having a low nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio with coarse nuclear chromatin and frequent nucleoli, 3) a high mitotic rate greater than 10/10 high power fields, and frequent necrosis, and 4) neuroendocrine features by immunohistochemistry or electron microscopy.
Surgery offers the best chance for a definitive diagnosis and curative treatment.

Axial CT scans in lung window setting demonstrate widespread small, bizarre shaped lung cysts with resultant parenchymal destruction. All lobes were involved with relative sparing of the costophrenic angles. 
Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed to obtain diagnostic wedge biopsy specimens of the right upper and right lower lobes. Pathologic findings were consistent with pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH).
","Pulmonary LCH refers to LCH isolated to the respiratory system, notably the lungs. This rare disease is found almost exclusively in cigarette smokers, which supports the theory of antigen exposure, since cigarette smoke contains thousands of known antigens. The radiologic findings of pulmonary LCH vary depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Diffuse bilateral ill-defined nodules will be seen in early stages. Because the disease has an inhalational component, the middle and upper lung zones are involved to a greater extent than the lung bases. It is thought that these nodules undergo cystic degeneration as the disease progresses, and so a reticular pattern begins to predominate on chest radiographs as the numerous cystic walls are superimposed on one another. The cysts and residual parenchyma can undergo fibrosis over time and eventually lead to changes of honeycombing. High-resolution CT plays an important role in the evaluation of pulmonary LCH. The diagnosis can be easily made with high-resolution CT by showing both ill-defined nodules and cysts in a heavy smoker. However, the diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution CT falls short when only nodules or cysts alone are present. Most of these cases are confirmed with lung biopsy.
Patients with pulmonary LCH have variable and uncertain clinical courses. Up to one-half will show clinical and radiographic stability, while up to 25% will demonstrate spontaneous regression. The remaining 25% can have continued cystic replacement of parenchyma that may progress to end-stage lung disease.

Axial images of contrast-enhanced chest CT also show diffuse, extensive dilatation of esophagus with food stagnation ","Achalasia is a well-recognized esophageal motility disorder characterized by a combination of absent peristalsis in the thoracic esophagus and impaired opening of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in response to deglutition. Two major forms of achalasia have been described: primary and secondary. The primary or idiopathic form is caused by degeneration of myenteric plexi in the wall of the esophagus. The etiology of this neural degeneration remains unknown but is postulated to be secondary to viral or autoimmune disease.

Transthoracic echocardiography was performed and showed normal size of cardiac chambers with good LV systolic function. (LVEF : 75%) 
Because the onset of dyspnea was sudden, bilateral pulmonary infiltrations appeared immediately after transfusion, and the patient had good cardiac function, cardiogenic pulmonary edema was excluded and transfusion-related acute lung injury was clinically suspected.
The patient was admitted for intensive respiratory care. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained on the next day showed no growth of abnormal organisms. Patient was treated with oxygen supplement and empirical antibiotics, but the symptoms aggravated and the patient expired 14 days after admission.
","Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), defined as the onset of respiratory distress after blood transfusion, is a potentially life-threatening complication of blood transfusion therapy. TRALI is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and diagnosis of this syndrome is established using clinical and radiological parameters. Suspected TRALI is defined as acute lung injury within 6 hours of transfusion in the absence of other risk factors, such as sepsis or lung contusion.
TRALI is known to occur with the transfusion of any cell-containing blood product, cryoprecipitates, intravenous immunoglobulins, and as little as 50 ml of plasma-rich blood product. Pathogenesis is not fully understood, but a two-hit hypothesis has been proposed. The first hit is underlying patient factors, such as sepsis or recent surgery, resulting in adherence of primed neutrophils to the pulmonary endothelium. The second hit is mediators in blood transfusion that activate the endothelial cells and pulmonary neutrophils, resulting in capillary leakage and subsequent pulmonary edema.
Radiographic findings of TRALI are nonspecific and are generally worse than the physical exam findings. Chest radiograph shows interstitial opacities, patchy alveolar opacities, and diffuse lung haziness. Septal lines and pleural effusions occasionally develop. Findings are usually indistinguishable from those of hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Lung opacities usually clear within 96 hours in 80% of patients diagnosed with TRALI. Chest CT shows parenchymal consolidations and air bronchograms, with or without ground-glass opacities in heterogeneous distribution. These findings can be seen in coexistence with normally aerated lung.
Management of TRALI is supportive, with most requiring supplementary oxygen, and mechanical ventilation is unavoidable in 70-90% of cases. TRALI is regarded as part of acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and diuretics and restrictive fluid strategy may be beneficial. TRALI generally has a good prognosis and mortality is considered to be roughly 5-10%.

Clinical and radiologic manifestations of amyloidosis are variable and  often nonspecific. Amyloidosis can be classified on the basis of its anatomic distribution into systemic (involving multiple organ systems) or localized (involving a single organ such as the lungs or the heart). It can also be classified on the basis of the structure of the protein deposits. The fibrillar proteins amyloid light chain (AL) and serum amyloid A (AA) are present in the vast majority of cases. Although thoracic involvement of amyloidosis is relatively rare, lungs, mediastinum, pleura, and heart may be involved in amyloidosis. The isolated tumefactive lesion, so called amyloidoma, may occur in the mediastinum, and it may manifest with various patterns of calcifications such as a punctate, diffuse, or eggshell calcification.
Characteristically, the amyloid deposit shows apple-green birefringence under polarized light on Congo-red staining. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is required in most patients with AL systemic amyloidosis who are associated with plasma cell dyscrasias, and the overall median survival in those patients who received chemotherapy was 5.1 years. In AA amyloidosis, the treatment goal is to manage the underlying disease, and successful treatment often leads to partial regression of the amyloid deposits.

Luschka (2) first described diffuse pulmonary ossification in 1856, and lately, two types of the disease have been distinguished: dendriform and nodular form. Dendriform ossification may be associated with a history of inflammation, fibrosis, or lung injury, and is characterized by coral-like dendritic pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan (1, 3, 4). Nodular ossification has been encountered in the clinical setting of cardiac disease and passive congestion, showing smoothly contoured, lobulated nodules on HRCT scan (1, 3, 4).

","Ortner's Syndrome is a rare clinical entity, first described in 1897. It describes left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy resulting from identifiable cardiovascular disease.
Left recurrent laryngeal nerve arises from the vagus nerve on the left side of the aortic arch. This nerve curves beneath the aorta on the outer side of ligamentum arteriosum and ascends to the groove between the esophagus and the trachea. It continues along this groove to supply all the muscles acting on the left vocal cord, except the cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve. 
In this syndrome, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is thought to be injured due to compression caused by changes in the anatomy of the heart or great vessels. Cardiovascular disease is an unusual cause of vocal cord palsy, and for this reason it is also known as cardiovocal syndrome.  Various underlying causes include left ventricular failure, atrial septal defect, Eisenmenger syndrome, mitral valve prolapse, primary pulmonary hypertension, aortic aneurysm, and aortic dissection.

We suspected lung torsion and recommended chest CT for further evaluation. Chest CT scan images with mediastinal window settings show twisting and narrowing of right middle lobe bronchus with swirling appearance of the bronchovascular structures. Pulmonary vessels still show enhancement after contrast infusion however. On thoracotomy, there was torsion of the right middle lobe. De-torsion was performed as the right middle lobe appeared viable.","Lung torsion is an uncommon disease that occurs mostly after lung resection (usually lobectomy or lingulectomy) and only rarely in thoracic trauma. It has also been described after lung transplantation, after fine-needle aspiration biopsy, and in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. Right middle lobe is the most commonly involved site after lung resection, but other lobes can also be involved. 
The early diagnosis of lung torsion is important because pulmonary hemorrhagic infarction or fatal gangrene can occur. However, it is often difficult or almost impossible to make early diagnosis because of its rare incidence and nonspecific clinical symptoms. Thus, a high index of suspicion is necessary.
Chest radiographic signs of lung torsion include a rapidly progressing consolidation, displacement of the hilar structures, bronchial cut-off or distortion. Atelectasis due to airway obstruction, abnormal positioning and orientation of pulmonary vessels and bronchi within the atelectatic lobe, abnormal position of the hilum in relation to the atelectatic lobe, and rapid expansion of an abnormally located consolidated lobe may also be seen.
CT findings include tapered obliteration of the proximal pulmonary artery and accompanying bronchus of the involved lobe and amorphous soft-tissue attenuation at the hilum. The torsed lobe demonstrates poorly enhancing consolidation with increased volume, ground-glass attenuation, interlobular septal thickening, and intralobular linear attenuation.

Contrast-enhanced chest CT scan demonstrates a homogenously enhancing soft-tissue mass in the left upper hemithorax with serpiginous branching linear areas of enhancement consistent with intralesional vessels.,"Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare neoplasm that typically presents as a well-defined lobulated soft tissue mass commonly arising from the visceral pleura. The tumors typically affect the pleura but can develop in a number of other locations including the mediastinum, lung, tracheobronchial tree, abdomen, head, neck, and central nervous system. It is common in the fifth and sixth decades of life but can develop at all ages and occur equally in males and females. Chest pain is the most common symptom, and enlarging tumors can compress bronchus, causing atelectasis. 
Chest radiographs of a patient with SFT of the pleura characteristically demonstrate a peripheral, well-defined, solitary nodule or mass. CT images of small SFTs typically show homogeneous, well-defined, lobular, non-invasive, soft-tissue nodules or masses. SFTs usually enhance strongly after contrast injection, which can be heterogeneous, particularly for large tumors. Heterogeneous attenuation of the tumor after contrast enhancement is correlated with hemorrhage, necrosis, or cystic change. Tumoral calcification occurs in 7% to 25% of patients, typically in those with larger tumors, and is often related to necrosis.
Surgical resection is the best treatment option. More than half are pedunculated, and video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is preferred to open surgery. Histologically, SFTs appear benign, although large tumors can show central necrosis and some atypia.

Tuberculosis of the airways typically involves the distal trachea and proximal main bronchi. In most cases, active infection and associated mediastinal inflammation result in diffuse increased density of mediastinal fat or enlarged mediastinal or pericardial lymph nodes on CT images. Untreated tuberculosis may lead to ulceration with resulting fistula between mediastinal lymph nodes and adjacent airways. The differential diagnosis includes bronchogenic carcinoma. Longer circumferential airway involvement and the absence of intraluminal mass favors tuberculosis.

Contrast enhanced axial chest CT scan showed 3.0cm sized well defined, oval shaped, pleura based mass in LUL. After 22 months, newly seen several subpleural nodules were observed. ","Amyloidosis is a heterogenous group of disorders associated with extracellular deposition of protein in various organs in an abnormal fibrillar form. Amyloidosis may present in systemic or localised forms, and pulmonary involvement may be localized, as in localized pulmonary amyloidosis, or represent part of a systemic process (systemic amyloidosis). Systemic amyloidosis can be further classified into primary and secondary systemic amyloidosis. Primary systemic amyloidosis (AL) is associated with an underlying monoclonal dyscrasia of plasma or B-lymphoid cells. In patients with primary amyloidosis, nearly one-third are ultimately diagnosed with either multiple myeloma or B-cell lymphoma, whereas approximatedly 10% to 15% of patients with myeloma or lymphoma develop amyloidosis. Secondary systemic amyloidosis (AA) is associated with chronic conditions such as tuberculosis, chronic renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. 
Pulmonary involvement in systemic amyloidosis is not uncommon, four distinct patterns of thoracic involvement of may be identified: (a) trachobronchial disease with airway wall thickening, nodular deposits of amyloid; (b) nodular parenchymal disease (c) diffuse alveolar septal disease (d) nodal disease. Nodular pulmonary amyloidosis (seen in the present case) carries the most favorable prognosis and long-term survival is expected even without treatment. Patients are typically asymptomatic and incidental findings of pulmonary nodules on routine chest radiographs are a common mode of presentation, although some may present with cough, shortness of breath and hemoptysis. However, a solitary nodule is a more common finding than multiple nodules on chest radiograph. On CT, pulmonary nodules have sharp and lobulated margins, and are usually found in a subpleural or peripheral location, more frequently in the lower lobes. The size of the nodules may range from micronodular to 15 cm in diameter. Over time, nodules may grow slowly and cavitate, calcify, or resolve spontaneously.

After treatment, previously noted bilateral multiple peripheral pulmonary nodules and right sphenoid sinusitis with osteomyelitis have improved.

","Actinomyces are Gram-positive, anaerobic bacteria, and they are commensals of the human oropharnynx, gastrointestinal tract and female genitalia, often routinely cultured from these mucosa-lined orifices. Pulmonary actinomycosis probably results from aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal secretions into the respiratory tract. Support for this theory comes from reports of a higher prevalence of alcoholism in patients with pulmonary actinomycosis and radiologically from the basal predominance of the disease. Pulmonary actinomycosis probably starts when saliva, or other material laden with Actinomyces species, is aspirated into a minor bronchus, causing atelectasis and a pneumonitis.  
Parenchymal patterns of pulmonary actinomycosis include cavitary or multifocal, peripheral pulmonary nodule, mass, or consolidation. On CT, consolidation with central low attenuation is found in 62-75 %, and 50-73 % is combined with adjacent pleural thickening. The disease initially manifests as a small, poorly defined, peripheral pulmonary nodule with or without interlobular septal thickening, and it gradually increases to segmental air-space consolidation, which suggests bronchogenic spread of the disease. If therapy is not adequate, the lesion slowly progresses, forming central areas of low attenuation with a cavity.

The symptoms associated with the endobronchial metastasis regardless of the primary sites are similar to those associated with a primary bronchogenic carcinoma or other primary endobronchial tumors.

There are several points on CT images that may assist in distinguishing an endobronchial tumor from a primary bronchogenic carcinoma. In endobronchial tumors, the long axis of the tumor is parallel to that of the bronchus, and may show a branching pattern adapting airways branches.
Strong enhancement is a characteristic CT finding of a renal cell cancer (RCC). Some studies have found that very strong enhancement of the mass is a unique CT finding of a conventional renal carcinoma, which can be used to differentiate this subtype from the other RCC subtypes.

PPFE is a rare entity that has been recently included in the official American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) statement in 2013 as a group of rare idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs). PPFE is characterized by pleural and subpleural parenchymal thickening due to elastic fiber proliferation, mainly in the upper lobes. Pathologically, interstitial fibrosis takes the form of a dense consolidation with some preservation of alveolar septal outlines and demonstrates a distinctly abrupt interface with residual normal lung. Unrecognized cases of PPFE may be incorrectly diagnosed as sarcoidosis, atypical idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or other unclassifiable interstitial pneumonias.The etiology of the disease is unclear, although some cases have been associated as a complication after bone marrow transplantation, lung transplantation, chemotherapy, and recurrent respiratory infections. The patients usually report progressive dyspnea and dry cough; pBetter awareness of the disease with its clinical and radiologic features can help with optimal management by the multidisciplinary team. Clinical outcome in PPFE is variable with a significant number of patients demonstrating progressive decline and death. Survival characteristics depend on the stage of the disease at presentation. Aside from lung transplantation, there is no demonstrated effective treatment.
Radiological differential diagnoses may include chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, atypical usual interstitial pneumonitis, collagen vascular diseases, irradiation injury, asbestos exposure, prominent apical cap fibrosis, and sarcoidosis.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1104-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1104-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1104-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1104-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1104-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1104-6.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1104-7.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1104-8.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1104-9.jpg']",127,"['correct:74/127', 'diff:3/127', 'semi:1/127']"

","Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an uncommon neoplasm that arises from the pleura or, rarely, the pericardium or peritoneum. CT findings that suggest MPM are unilateral pleural effusion, nodular pleural thickening, and interlobar fissure thickening. Growth typically leads to tumoral encasement of the lung with a rind-like appearance. 
MPM is locally aggressive, with frequent invasion of the chest wall, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Chest wall involvement may manifest as obliteration of extrapleural fat planes, invasion of intercostal muscles, displacement of ribs, or bone destruction. However, irregularity of the interface between the chest wall and the tumor is not a reliable predictor of chest wall invasion. Occasionally, MPM can extend into the chest wall via needle biopsy tracks, surgical scars, and chest tube tracts. Direct extension of the tumor into vascular structures and mediastinal organs including the heart, esophagus, and trachea may occur. There is usually obliteration of surrounding fat planes, and the presence of a soft-tissue mass that surrounds more than 50% of the circumference of a vascular structure is strong evidence of invasion. MPM may invade the pericardium and can be seen at CT as nodular pericardial thickening or pericardial effusion.

Transbronchial lung biopsy showed interstitial fibrosis with irregular septal wall thickening and chronic inflammatory cell and partial lymphomatous cell infiltrations. Eosinophilia is one complication of lymphoproliferative disorders that is rarely observed and sometimes the first manifestation of lymphoma. Absolute eosinophilia in the peripheral blood of patients with AIBTL was observed in 13 of 65 patients (21%) (1). Although the exact mechanism for the development of eosinophilia associated with lymphoma remains unclear, one possibility is due to the secretion of lymphokines by the transformed lymphocytes. When T-lymphocytes are stimulated and activated by antigens or mitogens, they begin to produce various lymphokines. Currently, three lymphokines (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-3, and IL-5) are known to induce eosinophilia.

Plasma cell type of Castleman disease typically demonstrates less avid enhancement after contrast material administration as compared to the hyaline vascular type. Calcification is uncommon. Plasma cell Castleman disease occurs more frequently as multicentric Castleman disease, with diffuse lymphadenopathy that involves multiple anatomic regions, including hilar and mediastinum, abdominal, pelvic, or cervical lymphadenopathy. Diffuse centrilobular pulmonary parenchymal nodular opacities in cases of plasma cell Castleman disease are often associated with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis.

The nodule shows heterogeneous attenuation without calcification on precontrast scan. After contrast administration, the nodule shows marked and heterogeneous enhancement (average 194 HU). 
Fig 6. FDG-PET/CT scan shows no definite hypermetabolism in the nodule.
","Hemangioma is a rare, benign vascular tumor that counts for less than 0.5% of all mediastinal masses. The cause of hemangioma is unclear. It has been speculated that they represent either true neoplasm or developmental vascular anomalies. At histologic examination, these tumors consist of large interconnecting vascular spaces lined by flattened cuboidal epithelium along with a varying amount of interspersed stromal elements, such as fat, myxoid, and fibrinous tissues. They are categorized as capillary, cavernous, or venous hemangiomas on the basis of the size of the vascular spaces. Most mediastinal hemangiomas are found in the anterior mediastinum; however, a few arise in the posterior mediastinum.
The preoperative diagnosis may be difficult because the tumors usually manifest as nonspecific mediastinal masses on image finding. Phleboliths, a potentially diagnostic finding, are seen in only 10% of conventional radiographs. Calcification is more readily identifiable on CT scans. Punctate calcification is seen more commonly and needs to be differentiated from the calcification seen in patients with teratoma or cartilaginous tumor. However, our case also did not contain any calcifications suggesting phleboliths.
Hemangiomas commonly appear as heterogeneous lesions on unenhanced CT scans. Their appearance depends on the stromal content and degree of thrombosed vascular channels. Contrast enhancement is most often heterogeneous and central. Gradually increasing and persistent enhancement has been seen on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT scans. Large draining veins have also been seen on delayed images. In our case, the hemangioma showed heterogeneous and avid enhancement but gradually increasing or persistent enhancement could not be confirmed because dynamic contrast scans were not taken.In mediastinal hemangiomas, FDG uptake is known to be as low and similar to hemangiomas of extremities. FDG-PET may provide information to differentiate hemangiomas from malignant neoplasms except for small or dominantly necrotizing lesions that PET cannot provide accurate data due to  limitation inspatial resolution.

","Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, immune- mediated illness wherein polyarthritis is most common presentation. Extra-articular manifestations are significant in prognostication, as they tend to correlate with mortality. In one study of 77 patients using HRCT of the chest, 22% of the patients were found to have rounded opacities in the characteristic location for rheumatoid pulmonary nodules being the second most commonly observed radiographic abnormality after bronchiectasis. Yousem and colleagues reported that 32.5% of RA patients undergoing open lung biopsy had rheumatoid nodules. Rheumatoid nodules are more common in men and in patients seropositive for rheumatoid factor. 
Most rheumatoid nodules are small and asymptomatic. However, they may cause cough and hemoptysis. Cavitation with discharge of their central necrotic debris into an airway has also been reported. Most nodules are peripheral and subpleural in location. The enlargement and ultimately the rupture of a subpleural nodule can cause pleural effusions with dyspnea and chest pain, pneumothorax pyopneumothroax and bronchopleural fistula formation. Finally they may give rise to abscess or undergo calcification. 
The differential diagnosis for cavitary pulmonary nodules may include ANCA positive granulomatous vasculitis, septic emboli, primary or secondary malignancies, amyloidosis, lymphoma, and tuberculosis though infection is the most likely cause. Importantly, malignancy and infections need to be ruled out, and tissue diagnosis is usually required. Rheumatoid nodules may remain stable or may regress spontaneously. In some cases they may enlarge and become symptomatic.

On contrast-enhanced CT, neurilemmomas demonstrate variable homogenous or heterogenous enhancement. Attenuation of the tumors on enhanced CT depends on the extent of Antoni A or B tissue and the amount of myxoid or cystic degeneration or hemorrhage.

First, a single cluster of small nodules is far more common in patients with tuberculosis than in those with sarcoidosis. Second, sarcoid clusters of small nodules are usually seen in the upper and middle lobes with almost the same frequency and are rare in the lower lobes, whereas most tuberculous clusters are in the upper lobes and the superior segments of the lower lobes in the same frequency, reflecting the typical distribution of post-primary pulmonary tuberculosis. Thus, clusters of small nodules in the middle lobe favor the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, and those in the lower lobe favor the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Finally, lymphadenopathy is common in patients with sarcoid clusters but is rare in patients with tuberculous clusters. Tree-in-bud lesions, one of the characteristic features of tuberculosis, should suggest the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

Most hamartomas are located in the periphery of the pulmonary parenchyma, but 1% to 20% may occur as endobronchial lesions and cause symptoms related to bronchial obstruction. Pulmonary hamartoma is a relatively common lesion that is usually discovered as an incidental, rounded focus of increased opacity on a routine chest film. These are benign tumors more common in males, with a peak incidence in the seventh decade of life. 
In about one-third of the cases, characteristic popcorn-like calcification is seen radiologically.  There is clinical, morphological, and radiological evidence to suggest that this lesion is acquired and that it represents a primary overgrowth of mesenchymal tissue of the bronchial wall, with secondary entrapment of the bronchial epithelium in the more peripheral lesions. 
Hamartoma occurring in the mediastinum is extremely rare, and only several cases have been reported; in a series of 215 cases of pulmonary hamartoma reported from the Mayo Clinic, none of them was located in the mediastinum. Whether mediastinal hamartomas may be described as primary mediastinal tumors or lesions that have migrated through the pulmonary parenchyma is not fully understood and is open to speculation.

The lesions were hypermetabolic on PET/CT scan. The patient underwent total thymectomy and wedge resection for multiple nodules in both lungs. The pathologic diagnosis of anterior mediastinal mass was thymic extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) with extensive plasma cell differentiation. Lung nodules were confirmed as lung involvement of thymic extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma and amyloid deposit.
","Primary low-grade B-cell MALT lymphoma is a rare tumor in the thymus. Most patients are Asians and associated with autoimmune disease, especially Sjögren syndrome.
Thymic MALT lymphomas are often accompanied with macroscopic or microscopic cyst formation. Cyst formation may be related to the tendency for cystic transformation of medullary duct-epithelium-derived structures (including Hassall corpuscles) when tumor grows in the thymic gland. Thymic MALT lymphoma needs to be included in the differential diagnosis for thymic masses accompanied by cystic changes and autoimmune diseases in Asian patients.
Sjögren syndrome is a systemic chronic inflammatory disorder but is also recognized as a lymphoproliferative disease with varying presentation from polyclonal lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary glands to oligo- or monoclonal B-cell proliferation resulting in clonally derived lymphoproliferative disorders such as monoclonal gammopathy, light-chain amyloidosis, and malignant lymphoma. In the study on primary Sjögren syndrome, Baqir et.al. found that pulmonary amyloidosis was associated with cystic lesions and nodules in the lung parenchyma. The mechanism of cyst formation in Sjögren syndrome is not fully understood.

Minor features include organomegaly, endocrinopathy, characteristic skin changes, papilledema, extravascular volume overload, and thrombocytosis. Diagnosis is often delayed because the syndrome is rare and can be mistaken for other neurologic disorders, most commonly chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.

Pulmonary vasculitides are noninfectious inflammatory disorders that affect the blood vessels of the lung, from the main pulmonary artery to alveolar capillaries. Histopathologically, they refer to a condition where acute or chronic cellular inflammation occurs within vessel walls and subsequently leads to blood vessel destruction and surrounding lung tissue necrosis. The nomenclature and classification of vasculitis have been proposed in 1994 and revised in 2012 by the International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference on the nomenclature of systemic vasculitis. This classification is based on the size of vessels principally involved (large, medium and small) and laboratory findings. Although the exact pathogenesis of vasculitis is still a matter of discussion and research, an immunological dysfunction is highly suggested by many clinical, pathological, and serological data derived from the affected patients. 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegeners granulomatosis) is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with the classic triad of upper airway involvement (sinusitis, otitis, ulcerations, bone deformities, subglottic or bronchial stenosis), lower respiratory tract involvement (cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and hemoptysis), and glomerulonephritis (hematuria, red blood cell casts, proteinuria, and azotemia). The median age of onset is 45 years. The classic histologic pattern of GPA is characterized by the presence of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules with frequent cavitation that are composed of large areas of parenchymal necrosis, granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis. Constitutional symptoms that include fever, arthralgia, myalgia, and weight loss and ocular involvement are common. Massive pulmonary hemorrhage can be a life-threatening manifestation. As few as 40% of patients have renal involvement at the initial presentation (limited form), but 80-90% of patients are known to eventually develop renal disease. Cytoplasmic ANCA (cANCA) is positive in more than 90% of patients with the generalized form, but it is detected in half of patients with the limited form of the disease. 
The most common radiographic abnormality of GPA is pulmonary nodules or masses (90%) with or without cavitation, which are frequently multiple and bilateral. They are presumed expression of granulomatous inflammation and necrosis. The second most common radiological manifestation is air-space consolidation and ground glass opacity (25%-50%), which are regarded to represent diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). In a small number of patients, centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud pattern have been described. Pleural effusion, unilateral or bilateral and of variable amount are quite uncommon, and in a small proportion of the patients, hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy can be detected (15%). Tracheal and bronchial involvement is a common manifestation in GPA, being reported in up to the 15%-25% and 40%-70% of patients respectively. Nodular appearance of inner surface of the airways may occur. Tracheal stenoses are usually subglottic, can be smooth or irregular, most commonly circumferential and about 2cm-4cm long. Segmental and subsegmental bronchial walls can be thickened and lumen can be stenotic, resulting in possible airway obstruction and atelectasis. With the introduction of the use of cyclophosphamide or steroid, complete remission has been achieved in 79%-90% of patients, but relapses are common. A poor prognosis is associated with DAH, severe azotemia, an advanced age, and positivity to cANCA. The main radiologic differential diagnoses include other diseases (particularly infections and neoplasms) that may essentially result in air-space consolidation, multiple nodules and masses, with or without cavitations. Septic embolism or multiple lung abscesses are usually associated with bacteremia and tend to mainly involve the lower lobes. Hematogeneous metastases also mainly involve the lower lobes. Cavitations are uncommon in lymphoma, and relatively rapid changes of the nodules and masses, often observed in GPA, is unlikely in malignancy.

Diffuse airway narrowing with nodularity is also noted on virtual bronchoscopy. On bronchoscopy, whitish nodular lesions with diffuse luminal narrowing of trachea and bronchi were seen. ","Amyloidosis is a disease characterized by extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrillar protein in various organs. Various forms of amyloidosis in the chest exist: nodular parenchymal amyloidosis, diffuse alveolar septal amyloidosis, airway amyloidosis, mediastinal amyloidosis, and cardiac amyloidosis. In primary amyloidosis, amyloid light chain (AL) is derived from the abnormal breakdown of immunoglobulin light chains. In secondary amyloidosis, the deposited protein is serum amyloid A (AA) , which is an acute-phase reactant noted in systemic infections and inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, chronic bronchitis, and osteomyelitis. Tracheobronchial amyloidosis occurs more often in a localized form. On CT, long segmental narrowing of the tracheobronchial lumen with wallthickening, nodules, or plaques are noted. Calcification or ossification of the involved airway is seen. Amyloidosis may involve the tracheal posterior membrane, unlike tracheobronchopathia osteochondroblastic or relapsing polychondritis, which spare the posterior membrane.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1127-1.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1127-2.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1127-3.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1127-4.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1127-5.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1127-6.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1127-7.JPG']",100,"['correct:19/100', 'diff:49/100']"

Parasitic eggs were identified from the percutaneous needle biopsy. ","Pulmonary paragonimiasis is a parasitic infection caused by trematodes (or lung flukes) of the genus Paragonimus. This disease is caused by ingestion of a raw or incompletely cooked freshwater crab or crayfish infected with the metacercaria. Paragonimus excyst in the small intestine, and the larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and enter the peritoneal space. Next they penetrate the diaphragm and pleura and enter the lung in 3–8 weeks, where they mature to adult flukes.
Patients with disease present with fever, chest pain, and respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough and hemoptysis. Diagnosis is confirmed through the detection of parasite eggs in the sputum, pleural fluid, or feces. In addition, the larvae can often be found via bronchial brushing. Intradermal and serologic tests are also available.
The common CT findings include pleural effusion, hydropneumothorax, pulmonary nodules or air-space consolidation, and cysts.
Radiologic findings correlate well with the stage of the disease. The penetration of juvenile worms through the diaphragm into the pleural cavity can cause pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Once the parasites reach the lung, patchy airspace consolidations can be observed, a phenomenon that reflects the presence of exudative or hemorrhagic pneumonia which can cavitate. Contrast-enhanced CT performed during this stage may show hypoattenuating fluid-filled cysts surrounded by hyperattenuating consolidation in the adjacent lung. Linear areas of increased opacity or hyperattenuation indicate peripheral atelectasis or worm migration. Worm cysts, whose diameters range from 0.5 to 1.5 cm, are better visualized after the consolidation resolves and manifest as either solitary or multiple nodules or gas-filled cysts depending on their content and their communication with the airway. Chest radiographic and CT findings include a ring shadow usually less than 3 mm thick and a crescent-shaped area of increased opacity or hyperattenuation within the cyst indicating that the worms have attached to the wall. Complications of cysts include pleural effusion, empyema, and pneumothorax.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1128-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1128-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1128-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1128-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1128-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1128-6.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1128-7.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1128-8.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1128-9.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1128-10.jpg']",101,"['correct:29/101', 'diff:14/101']"

It has been speculated that they represent either true neoplasm or developmental vascular anomalies. At histologic examination, these tumors consist of large interconnecting vascular spaces lined by flattened cuboidal epithelium along with a varying amount of interspersed stromal elements, such as fat, myxoid, and fibrinous tissues. Most mediastinal hemangiomas are found in the anterior mediastinum.
Preoperative diagnosis may be difficult because the tumors usually manifest as mediastinal masses with nonspecific image findings. Phleboliths, a potentially diagnostic finding, are seen in only 10% of conventional radiographs. Calcification is more readily identifiable on CT scans. Punctate calcification is seen more commonly and needs to be differentiated from the calcification seen in patients with teratoma or cartilaginous tumor. 
Hemangiomas commonly appear as well-circumscribed, heterogeneous soft-tissue masses on unenhanced CT scans. Their appearance depends on the stromal content and degree of thrombosed vascular channels. Contrast enhancement is most often heterogeneous and central. Gradually increasing and persistent enhancement has been seen on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT scans.

The axial CT image with lung window setting shows a mass with surrounding GGO, defined as the 'halo sign'. Compared with previous CT obtained 5 years ago (Fig 5, 6), the tumor shows slow growth in size. 
The patient underwent core-needle biopsy for the mass. The pathological diagnosis was sclerosing pneumocytoma. 
","Pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytomas (PSP), previously known as pulmonary sclerosing hemangiomas (PSH), also known as are rare benign neoplasms of the lung. It typically presents in middle age (30-50 years of age). There is a recognized female predilection. Most patients are asymptomatic. Symptoms if present will include hemoptysis, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and pleurisy. The lesions range from 0.8 to 8.2 cm in diameter, but most are less than 3.5 cm in diameter. 
Histologically, the essence is proliferation of type 2 pneumocytes, and a pneumocytoma consists of four major histologic components: solid, papillary, sclerotic, and hemangiomatous.
PSP typically presents on chest radiograph as a solitary, well-defined oval to rounded nodular lesion. Occasionally may contain areas of calcification and air-meniscus sign.
CT shows a smoothly marginated, homogeneously well-enhanced, round or oval nodule/mass with foci of calcification and air meniscus. Differentiation from lung cancer may be difficult on CT. A recent study reported that most patients had a single lesion (92.1%), smooth boundary (65.8%), and oval shape (65.8%), with a mean diameter of 2.27 cm. CT signs included marginal pseudocapsule (50%), overlying vessel (26.3%), air gap (2.6%), and halo sign (17.1%). 
PSP can be very challenging to diagnose in frozen sections, small biopsies, and cytology where they can easily be mistaken for adenocarcinoma or carcinoid tumors. These tumors typically have a benign clinical course, with metastasis being exceedingly rare. Treatment of PSP involves surgical resection and the prognosis is favorable.

"," Amyloidosis is a group of diseases resulting from the extracellular accumulation of abnormal protein in tissues and organs throughout the body. Amyloid protein deposits characteristically retain the dye Congo red, giving a pathognomonic red-green birefringence when viewed with a microscope under polarized light. 
Amyloidosis can be classified on the basis of its anatomic distribution or the structure of the protein deposits: systemic or localized. The biochemical classification system, according to the type of the fibrillar component in amyloid deposits, has over two dozen subtypes. The fibrillar proteins amyloid light chain (AL) and serum amyloid A (AA) are present in the vast majority of cases. 

Pulmonary involvement- Pulmonary amyloidosis is more often a localized process rather than a part of systemic disease.Two patterns of involvement exist: nodular parenchymal and alveolar septal forms. Nodular parenchymal amyloidosis may manifest as solitary or multiple pulmonary nodules and may mimic a variety of diseases from granulomatous disease to malignancy. Alveolar septal pulmonary amyloidosis is characterized by well-defined 2–4-mm micronodules with some calcifications accompanied by reticular opacities, interlobbular septal thickening, and confluent consolidations with basal and peripheral predominance. 

Airway involvement - It usually involves the airways diffusely and tends to result in submucosal plaques, but deposition can infrequently be solitary and mimic an endobronchial neoplasm. Usually, long-segment tracheal narrowing is encountered at imaging, which may be better appreciated on coronal and sagittal reconstructions.
Unlike tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica or relapsing polychondritis (which are cartilage disorders), amyloidosis may involve the tracheal posterior membrane.

Mediastinal involvement - Mediastinal involvement is most commonly seen with systemic amyloidosis and may consist of multistation lymphadenopathy or more anatomically localized involvement. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy may manifest with a variety of patterns of calcifications including punctate, diffuse, or eggshell.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1137-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1137-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1137-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1137-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1137-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1137-6.jpg']",81,"['correct:8/81', 'diff:11/81']"

","Scrub typhus (tsutsugamushi disease) is an acute febrile illness caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, characterized by focal or disseminated vasculitis and perivasculitis, which may involve the lungs, heart, liver, spleen, and central nervous system. Scrub typhus has epidemics in the late fall that affects a wide area of South-East Asia and the Pacific rim, including the Korean Peninsula. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of mites or chiggers. 
The diagnosis of scrub typhus is based on history of exposure, clinical features, and serological testing. The main clinical manifestations are high fever, skin rash, myalgia, lymph node enlargement, and characteristic eschar formation at the site of chigger feeding. The clinical course is usually mild and self-limited with spontaneous recovery after a few days, but some patients have a more severe course which may be fatal.
The radiological findings of scrub typhus are variable, ranging from normal to fulminant pulmonary edema. On chest radiography, bilateral diffuse areas of reticulonodular opacity, hilar lymph node enlargement, and septal lines are the most common findings. Airspace consolidation is relatively uncommon and generally appears in the lower zone of both lungs. Unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion is common, found in 12-43% of patients. On high-resolution CT, interlobular septal thickening, axial interstitial thickening, ground-glass opacity, and centriloular nodules with lower lung predilection are common findings. Consolidation and large nodules are less common. CT findings of scrub typhus may reflect cellular infiltration, edema, and hemorrhage caused by vasculitis or may be due to interstitial edema secondary to cardiac involvement.
The differential diagnosis of scrub typhus is pulmonary interstitial edema and pulmonary interstitial pneumonia, such as viral pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and Pneumocystis Jiroveci pneumonia, etc.

Most tumors are solitary and not associated with neurofibromatosis type I, but multiple neurofibromas and those with diffuse or plexiform morphology are associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. 
On histology, neurofibromas are composed of haphazardly arranged spindle cells with wavy nuclei, eosinophilic cytoplasm, and variably collagenous and myxoid matrix. At CT, endobronchial neurogenic tumors have been described as round or lobulated well-defined homogeneous masses. MR imaging may also be useful regarding the evaluation of the internal architecture of neurofibromas. The MR imaging features, such as the target sign on T2-weighted MR images, have been reported to be characteristic for neurofibromas. 
The treatment of endotracheal or endobronchial neurofibromas is determined by the size and the location of the tumor. Minimally invasive management can be achieved with endoscopic resection with or without laser. Surgical resection may be indicated in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain or when there is a concern for hemorrhagic complications, invasion of adjacent structures, or technical difficulties for bronchoscopic management.

","Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common complication of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. They are usually located in peripancreatic area and very rarely they may reach the mediastinum. 
Patho-physiologically, mediastinal pseudocyst can develop after rupture of the pancreatic duct into the retroperitoneal space. The pancreatic fluid then tracks through the diaphragmatic openings such as esophageal and aortic hiatus into the mediastinum.  
 Symptoms are primarily the results of compression or invasion of the mediastinal structures and may include dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, abdominal, chest and/or back pain, dyspnea, and cough. 
 A chest radiograph may be undiagnostic but can show retrocardiac opacity, pleural effusion, and atelectasis of basal lungs. Contrast-enhanced CT scan can show a thin-walled low-attenuating cystic mass extended from the pancreas into the mediastinum. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography can help identify the connection between the mediastinal and abdominal pseudocyst in cases where it not so evident on CT scan. Endoscopic ultrasound is increasingly used in evaluating pancreatic cysts due to its advantages in delineating contents and wall of the cysts. 
An elevated amylase or lipase level in the aspirated fluid from the mediastinal pseudocyst can confirm the diagnosis. 
Spontaneous regression of mediastinal pseudocysts is rare and therapeutic intervention is frequently required. It includes surgical drainage such as open laparotomy and percutaneous approach, and endoscopic drainage methods.

Among 48 patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving methotrexate who developed a lymphoproliferative disease, the primary site was the lung in four patients (4). In a separate report, 6 of 28 cases of lymphoproliferative disease involved the lung or pleura, but details were not provided (3). The reversibility of this disease without specific anti-lymphoma treatment suggests that diminished immune surveillance due to methotrexate may facilitate the development and expansion of malignant lymphoid clones.  A portion of these cases (28 %) is associated with EBV infection, a finding that is also seen in patients who are immunosuppressed in the setting of organ transplantation or AIDS (4).
The causal relationship between lymphoma and methotrexate use has been difficult to prove due to the increased rate of lymphoma among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Patient showed hypercalcemia and was diagnosed as secondary hyperparathyroidism due to end stage renal disease. He underwent surgery for calcinosis cutis on the scrotum, may be also related to secondary hyperparathyroidism. 
","Metastatic calcification refers to the deposition of calcium in soft tissue due to abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism. It is associated with hypercalcemia and is most common in patients with chronic renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism. It is reported to be present in 60-80% of patient with chronic renal failure at autopsy. Pathologically, metastatic pulmonary calcification is an interstitial process and depositions are seen predominantly in the alveolar septa, pulmonary arterioles and bronchioles.
Most patients with metastatic pulmonary calcifications are asymptomatic, but rarely in severe cases calcium depositions can lead to interstitial fibrosis, restrictive lung function and result in respiratory insufficiency.
Calcium salts precipitate in alkaline environment. Due to increased ventilation-perfusion ratio in lung apex compared to base, lung apex demonstrate lower PaCO2 and higher blood pH. It is hypothesized that because of this difference of pH between apex and base, metastatic calcification has a greated propensity to occur in upper lobes.
Plain radiographs are relatively insensitive in detecting metastatic calcification. In some patients, ill-defined nodules, or patchy areas of increased opacity may be seen. CT can show areas of ground glass opacity, consolidation, or calcification. Numerous fluffy and poorly defined nodules, measuring 3 to 10 mm in diameter, are typical, but opacities can appear focal, lobular, patchy, or diffuse. Even with HRCT, these opacities may not appear calcified. An apical predominance is common, because the apices are more alkaline than the bases, increasing the likelihood of calcium salt precipitation in this region.
Tc-99m MDP bone scintigraphy shows increased uptake in both lungs. Tc-99m MDP bone scintigraphy or mediastinal images on HRCT scan may be diagnostic of metastatic calcification without need for further investigation.

PAL commonly demonstrates a lenticular or crescent-shaped soft-tissue mass straddling the thickened pleura at the margin of a coexistent empyema cavity.

CT frequently depicts air–fluid levels or air bubble formation in the empyema cavity, and these signs may be associated with fistula formation caused by the tumor invasion. Fistula formation can also occur in chronic empyema without a tumor but is not common.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1152-12.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1152-12.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1152-12.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1152-12.jpg']",98,"['correct:73/98', 'diff:6/98']"

","Esophageal rupture may be traumatic, neoplastic, or spontaneous. Boerhaave syndrome is a spontaneous esophageal rupture and very rare surgical emergency, most usually diagnosed in men aged 50-70 years. And it occurs in patients vomiting after ingestion of heavy meal combined with large alcohol consumption. Thy typical site of rupture is on the left posterior aspect of the distal esophagus, 2-3cm proximally to the gastroesophageal junction. The pathogenesis is sudden increased pressure caused by forceful vomiting against a closed glottis because of incomplete cricopharyngeal relaxation.
Clinical findings include vomiting, sudden severe chest pain, and subcutaneous emphysema. That is also called Macler`s triad. Dyspnea is frequently observed due to pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or atelectasis. However, in many cases the initial signs are nonspecific, such as sepsis, fever, and hypotension. It is misdiagnosed as acute aortic dissection, aortic rupture, myocardial infarction, perforated peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, or others. 
Fluoroscopic esophagography with ingestion of water-soluble contrast medium was used to confirm suspected esophageal perforation throught the direct demonstration of extraluminal contrast extravasation. Currently, multidetector CT-esophagography has been useful diagnostic tool of Boerhaave syndrome.

Figure 6. CT scan with mediastinal window setting shows relatively high attenuation of the liver compared to spleen.","Amiodarone is an iodinated benzofuran derivative that is used to suppress ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Pulmonary toxicity is among the most serious adverse effects of amiodarone. Several forms of pulmonary disease occur among patients treated with amiodarone, including interstitial pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, ARDS, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary nodules and solitary masses, and also pleural effusion. Other adverse effects from amiodarone include photosensitivity, blue-gray discoloration of the skin, thyroid dysfunction, corneal deposits, abnormal liver function tests, and bone marrow suppression.
Radiology plays a central role in diagnosis. Chest x-rays reveal patchy or diffuse infiltrates, which are commonly bilateral. Some infiltrates have a ground glass appearance. Computed tomography scanning often reveals bilateral interstitial, alveolar or mixed interstitial and alveolar infiltrates. Parenchymal infiltrates that have high attenuation are typical and believed to be associated with the iodinated properties of the drug and its prolonged half-life in the lung. Ground glass opacities are appreciated more easily and seen more frequently on CT scanning. They are often distributed in a peripheral manner and may be an early finding in amiodarone induced pulmonary toxicity. Pleural thickening is commonly seen, especially in areas where the infiltrates are densest. Pleural effusions have been described but are less common. High attenuation may be noted incidentally during CT on views of the liver and spleen, related to the accumulation of amiodarone and its metabolites in tissue macrophages. 
Once the diagnosis of APT is considered likely, the drug should be discontinued. After stopping, amiodarone resolution is likely to be slow and some degree of worsening may occur before improvement is noted. This has been attributed to the long elimination half-life of the drug and the tendency to concentrate in tissues such as the lung. 
Systemic corticosteroids are recommended for the treatment, although controlled trials demonstrating efficacy are lacking. Cases of relapse on early steroid withdrawal have been reported. 
The prognosis of amiodarone lung disease is generally favorable when diagnosed early. However, more advanced disease may be fatal or result in pulmonary fibrosis. Mortality is highest among those who develop ARDS.

","Pulmonary artery sarcoma is rare tumor (0.001%) and arises from the intimal layer of the pulmonary artery. The common symptoms are dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, fever, and constitutional symptoms. This tumor can frequently be misdiagnosed as chronic pulmonary thromboembolism. CT and PET are useful tools for diagnosis of pulmonary artery sarcoma. Contrast-enhanced CT can detect an eccentric filling defect or complete occlusion of the proximal or main pulmonary artery, the expansion of the involved arteries, and extraluminal tumor extension. These CT findings can also be seen in cases of extensive pulmonary thromboembolism. FDG-PET may be useful in differentiating pulmonary thromboembolism and pulmnary artery sarcoma, as blood thrombi do not take up 18F-FDG, whereas a malignant tumor. However, some reports indicate that PASs may not always show high FDG uptake. Metastasis can occur in the lung (50%) and other organs (16%).

The diagnosis of AT is usually delayed because of its nonspecific clinical presentation and the lack of radiographic findings in the early stages, which results in a high mortality rate.
As regards imaging findings, the literature describes tracheal or bronchial wall thickening as the main finding. Presence of multifocal, irregular plaques on the tracheal wall, many times with high attenuation due to the Aspergillus sp capacity to fix calcium, is also described. 
Transbronchial biopsy in association with sample culture presents high diagnostic accuracy, but many times it is contraindicated by the presence of thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy observed in patients affected by malignant hematological diseases.

The right cardiac chambers are enlarged and right ventricle is hypertrophic on a four-chamber view of echocardiographic exam, that means pulmonary arterial hypertension with right ventricular hypertrophy. ","Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) is characterized by abnormal proliferation of capillaries within alveolar septa on pathology. The clinical manifestation includes progressive dyspnea, fatigue and chronic cough with gradual development of right heart dysfunction, which are representing as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The rarity of PCH frequently insults in misdiagnosis to idiopathic PAH, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis or pulmonary hemosiderosis. Unlike idiopathic PAH caused by elevated medial hypertrophy of the pulmonary arterioles, PAH is explained by the sustained reflection of pressure elevation in capillary bed as in PCH, or PVOD in the pulmonary veins. PCH may be associated with secondary PVOD, and the distinction of PCH from PVOD may be difficult. 
 The radiologic appearance typically includes features of both PAH and pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. The chest radiographic findings are enlarged central pulmonary arteries with right ventricular hypertrophy and occasionally visible diffuse or bibasilar reticulonodular or micronodular GGO. On CT, widespread ill-defined centrilobular GGNs are consistently described in PCH, often mixed with lobular GGOs. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy can be associated. In contrast to PVOD, septal line thickening, pleural effusion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is unusual but may be present due to secondary PVOD. Pulmonary arteriography usually appears normal. In the setting of unexplained PAH, the clinical and radiologic diagnosis of PVOD and PCH can be very difficult, and histologic examination is regarded as the most reliable means to establish the diagnosis.
Although the only curative therapeutic option of PCH or PVOD is heart-lung transplantation, medical therapies serve as supportive care and a bridge to transplantation. Major pharmacological agents are vasodilators to decreased pulmonary vascular resistance, increase cardiac output and reduce volume overload. In many cases, however, potent vasodilators induce florid and even fatal pulmonary edema in patients with PCH or PVOD.

Intraoperative finding showed multiple pores at the right diaphragm, suggesting catamenial pneumothorax. The result of excisional biopsy of the diaphragm was mild chronic inflammation and no endometriotic tissue was documented. ","Catamenial pneumothorax (CP) is a spontaneous recurring pneumothorax that occurs in women and is correlated with menses. CP was generally considered a rare entity. Its incidence in large epidemiological studies is only 3-6%. It is believed that CP is underdiagnosed and the incidence of CP has been often underestimated. CP involves the right side in the vast majority of cases. It can be left sided or rarely may be bilateral. 
CP etiology is most likely multifactorial in origin involving a combination of different mechanisms. Currently, three different mechanisms have been proposed, namely: (1) transdiaphragmatic passage of peritoneal air, originating from the genital tract, through the fallopian tubes; (2) sloughing of endometrial implants from the visceral pleura, with subsequent air leakage; and (3) alveolar rupture due to prostaglandin-induced bronchiolar constriction or obstruction by bronchiolar endometrial implants. Transdiaphragmatic passage of air is currently the most widely accepted hypothesis, although it cannot explain every case. Cervical mucus plug liquefaction during the menstrual period allows passage of external air through the uterine cavity into the peritoneal one. Air may then reach the pleural space through diaphragmatic fenestrations, helped by negative intrathoracic pressure, implying the occurrence of pneumoperitoneum as an intermediate step.
The typical clinical presentation of CP involves spontaneous pneumothorax during or preceding menses, usually manifested with pain, dyspnea and cough. 
Although there are generally no specific diagnostic imaging criteria, CT remains the first-line imaging method, as it can rule out other diagnoses and map the lesions for surgery if necessary. Diaphragmatic implants may appear as hypo-attenuating areas on CT, sometimes associated with an iso-attenuated component, depending on the size and blood content. Other rare imaging findings include pneumoperitoneum co-existing with right pneumothorax, small diaphragmatic defects, nodular appearance of the diaphragm on chest X-ray and CT corresponding to partial intrathoracic liver herniation. 
Characteristic operative findings include diaphragmatic defects, and/or spots or nodules (usually endometrial implants) on the diaphragm, and/or the visceral and/or the parietal pleura. 
Endometriosis tissue may or may not be found in the characteristic lesions. The spots and nodules are usually found to be endometrial implants. Endometrial tissue has been also found at the edges of the diaphragmatic defects, which may represent cyclical breakdown of endometrial implants. However, macroscopic evidence of thoracic endometriosis and furthermore histologically proven thoracic endometriosis is not revealed in all cases of catamenial pneumothorax.

For treatment, partial diaphragmatic resection and/or resection of visceral pleural implants, and pleurodesis, are frequently performed. In addition, hormonal treatment (GnRH) immediately after surgery is now suggested for all patients with proven CP.

Extrathyroidal extension in thyroid cancer represents a gradual mechanism of infiltration from the outer to the inner wall layers of the trachea. When pathologically reviewed, tumor infiltration can be noted to occur in the cartilaginous spaces rather than the cartilaginous ring. The PTC cells invade the laryngotracheal system by bluntly dissecting along blood vessels and collagen fibers oriented perpendicularly to the tracheal lumen in between cartilaginous rings.

The mass is characteristically well circumscribed, is rounded or ovoid, and may have a notched or lobulated contour. These lesions typically range in size from 2 to 5 cm. 
At CT, carcinoid tumors appear as a spherical or ovoid nodule or mass with a well-defined and slightly lobulated border.

They are typically located close to central bronchi, often near the bifurcation area. Calcification is usually not visible on chest radiographs, but on CT images calcification or ossification can be seen in up to 30% of tumors and manifests in a punctate or diffuse pattern. 
 Carcinoids tend to be vascular and may demonstrate intense enhancement. This is particularly helpful for distinguishing the tumor from obstructive atelectasis or an adjacent mucus plug.

","Hemangiomas are uncommon benign vascular tumors that account for less than 0.5% of mediastinal masses. Mediastinal hemangiomas usually occur in young patients, before age of 35 years. It has been speculated that they represent either true neoplasm or developmental vascular anomalies. Most mediastinal hemangiomas are found in the anterior mediastinum, however, a few arise in the posterior mediastinum. At histologic analysis, these tumors consist of large interconnecting vascular spaces lined by flattened cuboidal epithelium along with a varying amount of interspersed stromal elements, such as fat, myxoid, and fibrous tissues. They are categorized as capillary, cavernous, or venous hemangiomas and more than 90% are capillary or cavernous.
Hemangiomas commonly appear as heterogeneous lesions on unenhanced CT scans, and contrast enhancement is most often heterogeneous and central. Gradually increasing and persistent enhancement has been seen on dynamic contrast-enhancement CT scans. Large draining veins have also been seen on delayed images. Phleboliths, thought to be pathognomonic, are visible in up to 10% of cases on plain radiographs. In our imaging, a dilated vein draining into the left innominate vein was seen. And also, tiny punctate calcification which consistent with a phlebolith is a diagnostic of hemangioma. 
The differential diagnosis includes mediastinal lymphoma, lymphangioma and teratoma. Mediastinal lymphoma can appear as a heterogeneous mediastinal mass but calcification is exceedingly rare. Lymphangiomas usually are cystic lesions that typically do not enhance. Dilated vein is a feature suggestive of hemangioma rather than teratoma.

","Pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules (PMLNs) have been found in patients ranging in age from 12 to 91 years, mostly in the seventh decade of life with a marked female predilection. Pathologically, PMLNs are small (100 um to a few mm) nodules which are composed of cells similar with meningothelial cells. Most PMLNs are usually solitary and found incidentally without related clinical manifestations during testing for other diseases. However, multiple lesions can be encountered and have occurred in up to 41% of all patients with PMLNs. If these lesions are small and numerous, this condition has been termed as diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM).
Radiologic features of DPM are nonspecific, but, scattered minute areas of ground-glass attenuation are characteristic. The lesions presented in a random distribution but had a tendency to be located in the periphery of the lung. There is an assumption that the spread of the lesion along the alveolar walls likely results in the ground-glass attenuation on HRCT.
It has benign course, thus, conservative treatment is favorable. Therefore, this entity should be distinguished from metastatic carcinomas with prominent lymphatic spread in the lungs.

Peripheral blood eosinophilia is usually mild or moderate but occasionally is severe. Blood eosinophilia is present in 90% of patients. The percentage of eosinophils in the BAL fluid is very high. Histologic examination typically shows accumulation of eosinophils and lymphocytes in the alveoli and interstitium, with interstitial fibrosis.
The imaging findings of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia are characterized by ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities. A peripheral and upper lung distribution is typical and the findings have been described as the photographic negative appearance of classic central pulmonary edema. CT demonstrates typical nonsegmental areas of airspace consolidation or ground-glass opacity with peripheral predominance.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), or Rendu-Osler-Weber disease, is a rare autosomal dominant multiorgan pathology characterized by the presence of multiple small telangiectases of the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs, with associated recurrent episodes of bleeding from affected sites. Although everyday symptoms in these patients are dominated by epistaxis that may markedly alter their quality of life, more severe manifestations of the disease are due to the consequences of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) and, less often, to liver, brain, or gastrointestinal tract involvement. The diagnosis of HHT requires the presence of at least three of the following Curacao criteria: recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasis, an autosomal dominant familial distribution of the disease, and visceral AVMs. PAVM is the most frequent lesion of the lung in patients with HHT. It is usually silent at the time of PAVM induced. Strokes and brain abscess can be diagnosed at low risk.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1168-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1168-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1168-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1168-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1168-5.jpg']",138,"['correct:124/138', 'diff:7/138']"

","The incidence of lobar torsion is rare, occurring in 0.089-0.3% of patients following lobectomy. Lobar torsion is most commonly observed after thoracic surgery, and torsion of the right middle lobe after right upper lobectomy is the most common. It may also occur in traumatic or spontaneous condition.
Clinical findings include fever, tachycardia, dyspnea, and decreased breathing sounds, but these findings are not specific enough to make a confirmative diagnosis. Radiologic and bronchoscopic findings may be specific to make a correct diagnosis. Specific radiographic findings include rapid opacification or serial position change of the affected lobe. Post-operative follow-up with chest radiograph is most important for the correct diagnosis of a lobar torsion. On CT scan, the lobe will typically enhance poorly and have either ground glass attenuation/consolidation. The affected lobe can expand or undergo complete collapse. The bronchi and hilar vessels supplying the torsed lobe may exhibit cut-offs. The hilum can be displaced due to abnormal rotation. Lobar air-trapping with expansion of the twisted lobe owing to hemorrhagic engorgement and infarction may also be observed. Bronchoscopy may reveal an abnormally tight and obstructed orifice of the affected lobe. 
In most cases, resection is performed due to irreversible ischemic change of the distorted lobe. In a few patients, simple de-torsion is carried out. If lobar torsion is suspected, exploratory thoracotomy should be performed without delay to prevent serious morbidity and mortality. To reduce the risk of lobar torsion, the right middle lobe can be fixed to the right lower lobe, especially if the fissure is well developed.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1169-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1169-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1169-3.jpg']",126,"['correct:31/126', 'diff:1/126', 'semi:48/126']"

Other less frequently involved organ systems include the central and peripheral nervous system and large joints. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory findings. Because thoracic involvement often predominates, chest radiographic findings are often the first to suggest the diagnosis. 
Pulmonary nodules and masses are the most common CT findings of ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis and are seen in up to 70% of patients. Waxing and waning of the single or multiple pulmonary nodules and masses with random distribution are features of the disease. 
Central cavitation occurs in up to 50% of cases and is more common in nodules larger than 2 cm. Cavity walls may be smooth and thin or irregular and thick. CT halo sign (up to 15%) or reverse halo sign, radiating linear scarring, and pleural tags can be ancillary findings. Diffuse ground-glass opacity and consolidation (50%) may result from pulmonary hemorrhage or infection and bilateral perihilar and peribronchovascular distributions are the most common. 
The tracheobronchial tree is the second most commonly affected area in the thorax (16-23% of cases) and subglottic portion of the trachea is most often common location. Segmental, focal, circumferential wall thickening involving the posterior membrane of the trachea is the typical radiologic findings. Pleural involvement (12-20% of the patient) causing pleural effusion and pleuritis and cardiac involvement as a form of pericarditis, coronary arteritis and myocardial ischemia owing to the vasculitis in small to medium-sized coronary artery could be also presented. 
Although pathogenesis is unclear, the immunosuppression with corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide is the best current therapy (remission rate; 87%).

","Bronchogenic cyst results from an anomalous supernumerary budding of the ventral or tracheal diverticulum of the foregut during the sixth week of gestation and is thus part of the spectrum of bronchopulmonary foregut malformations.
The most frequent location is mediastinal and subcarinal region. Bronchogenic cysts usually contact the carina or main bronchi but may be seen anywhere along the course of the trachea and larger airways.
Bronchogenic cysts vary in size and may be quite large. They are usually discrete and unilocular. The cyst contents usually consist of thick mucoid material. The cysts can grow very large without causing symptoms but may compress surrounding structures, particularly the airway, and give rise to symptoms .In rare cases, they can become infected or hemorrhage may occur into the cyst. These complications may be life threatening, particularly in infants and young children
Differential diagnosis for uncomplicated cysts includes congenital cysts and malformations, such as pericardial cyst, cystic hygroma, lymphangioma, neurenteric cyst, and esophageal duplication cyst. If the cysts are complicated (with infection or hemorrhage), they may show high attenuation and/or enhancing thick wall.

","Endometriosis is the condition wherein endometrial tissue is present outside of the uterine cavity. It is encountered most commonly in pelvic structures such as the ovary, uterine ligaments, pelvic peritoneum, cervix, labia, and vagina. Although endometriosis in general can affect up to 15% of women in their reproductive years, endometriosis involving pleura or lung is rare, and its prevalence remains unknown because of a paucity of relevant studies.
The most common clinical manifestation of pleural endometriosis is the recurrent shortness of breath due to recurrent pneumothorax. Less frequent presentations include recurrent hemorrhagic pleural effusion, hemoptysis, or catamenial pain. Catamenial hemothorax represents the second-most common manifestation, occurring in 14 % of known cases, and affects the right side in about 80 % of the time.
Chest X-rays in cases of pleural endometriosis usually reveal pneumothorax or occasionally pleural abnormality such as pleural effusion or nodular lesion. Chest CT scan may show pleural or diaphragmatic thickening in involved areas. In the present case, radiologic investigations revealed a right-sided loculated pleural effusion and diaphragmatic thickening. In contrast, chest X-rays in parenchymal endometriosis show nodular infiltrates or opacification.
Pleural endometriosis is almost invariably confined to the right side. The lesions are characteristically multiple, dark red or blue, nodules or cysts, commonly on the diaphragmatic pleura.
Microscopically, endometriosis typically consists of both endometriotic glands and stroma. The glands usually have an endometrioid appearance ranging from inactive to proliferative (or occasionally, secretory) to hyperplastic. 
Diagnosis is frequently delayed until several episodes have occurred as patient fails to associate symptoms with menstruation. A pleural fluid cytology is usually not helpful. CA-125 level may be elevated in the serum and body cavity fluid of patients with endometriosis. The concentration of CA-125 correlates with both the severity and the clinical course of the disease. 
Therapeutic management for pleural endometriosis includes the suppression of endometrial tissue and the prevention of further pelvic seeding. Medical therapy should be considered as the first line treatment, commonly with oral contraceptives, progesterone agents, danazol, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, to suppress the ovarian estrogen secretion. Pleurodesis may be considered as a means of preventing the recurrence of hemothorax.
Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy, although effective, results in permanent infertility and does not address dormant endometrial implants that may become active with administration of exogenous estrogen.

","Extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma, also called low grade B cell lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), is an extranodal lymphoma that arises in a number of epithelial tissues, including the stomach, salivary gland, lung, small bowel, thyroid, and elsewhere. Extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of the lung is sometimes referred to as bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) lymphoma.
On chest radiographs, recurrent or secondary pulmonary lymphoma may present with various patterns: bronchovascular or lymphangitic with thickening of bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septae (41%), discrete pulmonary nodular (39%), pneumonic or alveolar with areas of consolidation (14%), and miliary or hematogenous with disseminated micro nodules (6%) 1251. Lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion is also commonly present. Other manifestations include cavitary and endobronchial masses.
Lewis et al. 151 reviewed the CT findings of pulmonary parenchyma lymphoma in 31 patients with recurrent or secondary non-Hodgkin’s or Hodgkin’s disease. In that study, the most common CT findings were masses or mass-like areas of consolidation larger than 1 cm (68% of patients) and nodules smaller than 1 cm (61 % of patients), slightly different from the results of previous studies on radiographs. However, three or more CT abnormalities were present in 68% of patients. 
Lymphomatous involvement of the lung is often asymptomatic, and when symptoms do occur, they are often nonspecific, thus making the clinical diagnosis difficult. Diagnosis is also difficult because infection, granulomatous disease, primary or secondary carcinomas, or drug reactions may cause similar abnormal radiologic findings. Careful correlation of clinical, microbiologic, and histologic findings is
necessary.

Pulmonary paragonimiasis is a food-borne parasitic disease caused by the lung fluke Paragonimus westermani, which is endemic in Southeast Asia and the Far East. It has a complex life cycle and ingested metacercariae excyst in the small intestine, migrate through the intestinal wall and enter the abdominal cavity. Next they penetrate the diaphragm and pleura and enter the lung in three to eight weeks, where they develop into the adult worms.
Typical pulmonary symptoms are fever, chest pain, and respiratory symptoms, including a chronic cough with homoptysis.  Peripheral blood examinations can show leukocytosis and eosinophilia in many patients.
Paragonimiasis may be categorized into pulmonary, pleuropulmonary and extra-pulmonary forms. Radiographically, paragonimiasis is dependent on which stage in the development of the disease has been currently reached. The most common manifestation observed was pleural lesions from simple pleural thickening to bilateral hydropneumothorax. The characteristic CT features of pulmonary paragonimiasis were round low attenuation cystic lesions filled with fluid or gas. CT scan also showed air-space consolidation, nodules, worm migration track, and bronchiectasis. The prevalence of pleural effusion varies.
The diagnostic criteria of paragonimiasis are based on clinical history, radiological findings, absolute eosinophilia, positive findings on a serological test, or detection of eggs or worms in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or stool or in a pathologic specimen. A specific IgG antibody test using the ELISA is helpful both in suggesting a diagnosis and in ruling out infections. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary paragonimiasis.

The patient in this case lives in Los Angeles in southern California, which is an endemic area. The lungs are the target organ in coccidioidomycosis and are involved in a wide spectrum of clinical and imaging manifestations that are categorized as acute, disseminated, or chronic disease. 
Coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed by means of direct visualization of mature spherules with special-stain microscopy or isolation of Coccidioides species from biologic specimens at culture, such as sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, smear from cutaneous lesions, or tissue biopsy samples. In this case, we performed percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy at the consolidation in the right lower lobe to confirm the diagnosis. Coccidioides species was identified through culture of the tissue specimens.

The distribution is mostly unilateral, with perihilar and basilar predominance. The density of parenchymal opacification varies from a ground-glass appearance to dense homogenous consolidation, simulating bacterial pneumonia. Another common parenchymal manifestation is nodular opacities, seen in as many as 20% of cases at chest radiography. They are often multiple and well circumscribed and are seen predominantly in the perihilar and lower lung zones, simulating metastatic disease. Mediastinal adenopathy occurs in cases of severe and prolonged lung infection, and paratracheal or other mediastinal adenopathy suggests a greater risk of disseminated disease. Pleural effusion occurs in 15-20% patients with acute disease. In this case, relatively segmental consolidation and peripheral ground-glass attenuation are seen in the lungs, which mimic bacterial pneumonia. 
	Disseminated disease is the most severe manifestation of coccidioidomycosis. The classic pulmonary manifestation of disseminated disease is miliary nodules caused by hematogenous spread. Chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed when clinical symptoms or imaging abnormalities persist beyond 6 weeks and occurs in 5% of patients. Imaging findings of chronic disease include residual nodule, chronic cavity, persistent pneumonia with or without adenopathy, pleural effusion, and regressive changes.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1179-1.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1179-2.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1179-3.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1179-4.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1179-5.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1179-6.JPG']",87,"['diff:2/87', 'semi:9/87']"

"," Mesenchymal cystic hamartoma of the lung (MCH) is a very rare disease with an indolent clinical course that is predominantly comprised of immature mesenchymal cells. Imbalance in growth of the endodermal respiratory epithelium and the mesodermal vascular elements, leads to the formation of nodules and cysts.
Although MCH may be detected in infancy, 3 or 4 decades usually elapse before it comes to clinical attention. The reported age range is from 1.5 to 53 years and the male-female ratio is 4:11. 
Imaging shows propagation of new nodules and enlargement of cysts multiple cysts or nodules in most patients. The cysts were 1 to 10 cm in diameter, whereas the nodules were several millimeters to 1 cm. The nodules and cysts represent different stages of the same disease with the nodules occurring first. As the nodules become bigger, especially after reaching a diameter greater than 1 cm, the nodules usually transform into cysts. The cysts and nodules are more commonly seen in a bilateral distribution, but the lesions may be unilateral at the earlier stages. 
MCH shows benign course in most cases. In some cases, hemorrhage from the systemic arteries into the cysts causes hemoptysis. Other serious complications include pneumothorax or hemothorax from rupture of a subpleural cyst and very rarely malignant transformation (mesenchymal sarcoma). 
MHC needs to be differentiated from the other conditions which have similar clinicoradiographic presentations like pleuropulmonary blastoma, cystic adenomatoid malformation and lymphangiomyomatosis. 
A surgical procedure is probably necessary to correct complications and establish the diagnosis; however routine surgical resection is not recommended due to the multicentric and usual benign nature of the disease. Close surveillance is recommended due to the potential of malignant transformation.

"," Intravascular lymphomatosis (IVL), also known as malignant endotheliomatosis or angiotropic large-cell lymphoma, is a rare and distinctive form of malignant lymphoma characterized by the proliferation of neoplastic lymphoid cells, mostly of B-cell origin, in the vascular lumina. The disease can affect vessels in any organ.
 The clinical features of IVL are nonspecific, but IVL most commonly manifests as fever of unknown origin, weight loss, night sweats, dementia, and cutaneous nodules or plaques. With vascular occlusion of various organs and attendant diverse and confusing clinical presentations, the diagnosis of IVL is usually deferred. IVL has been confused with other possible conditions including vasculitis, dementia, or infarction, occult neoplasm, and infection. When the lungs are involved, patients experience shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and, rarely, pulmonary hypertension, and the disease may simulate various lung diseases, particularly diffuse interstitial lung disease or a subacute or chronic infectious condition. Moreover, due to the rarity of this condition, ready diagnosis of the disease is difficult, and lung lesions in patients with IVL are often detected at autopsy.
 To date, there have been several reports about the radiologic findings of lung IVLs. Although the main computed tomographic (CT) finding of lung IVLs is diffuse ground-glass opacity (GGO), the disease also may demonstrate subpleural patchy areas of consolidation and reticulonodular lesions. These CT manifestations of IVL are nonspecific and can be seen in patients with diverse diseases, which may cause delayed diagnosis of this rapidly progressive and diffuse vascular tumorous condition.

","	Hydatid disease is a parasitic disease produced by the larval stage of the Echinococcus tapeworm. This disease occurs usually in the Mediterranean region, Africa, South America, the Middle East, Australia, and New Zealand. Dogs are the definitive hosts of Echinococcus tapeworms. Sheep, goat, and swine are intermediate hosts. Humans might become intermediate hosts by contacting a definitive host or ingesting contaminated water or vegetables. The eggs of the parasites pass through the intestinal wall, lodge in various organs via the portal venous system, and then form cystic lesions (hydatid cysts). The common sites of disease are the liver (75%) and lung (15%). Occasionally, it could involve the spleen, brain, heart, and kidneys. Pulmonary hydatid cysts are most common in the lower lobes (60%). They present in multiples in 30% of cases and bilaterally in 20% of cases. Typical findings are well-defined cystic lesions with fluid attenuation, homogenous content and smooth, hyperdense walls. Calcification is very rare in pulmonary cysts. Clinical symptoms depend on the location and size of cystic lesions.

","Lymphangioma is a benign disease that can occur at any organs in the body. However, pulmonary lymphangioma is an extremely rare disease. Abnormal development and proliferation of lymphatic vessels that do not communicate with normal lymphovascular system lead to the development of pulmonary lymphangioma. In case without having a lymphatic drainage, it may increase as time passes. In 90% of the cases, lymphangioma develops in early childhood up to the age of 2 years.
For the imaging findings, pulmonary lymphangioma may appear as a thin-walled cystic or multi-lobulated mass with a well-defined border and homogeneous density in the localized type. Calcification or contrast enhancement is unusual. At MRI, the cystic component shows iso or low signal intensity to muscle on T1-weighted image and high signal intensity to fat on T2-weighted image. Imaging studies are helpful in delineating the extent of the disease preoperatively but it is difficult to make a proper diagnosis based on the imaging alone as there are no specific imaging features of the lymphangioma.
Pulmonary lymphangioma may remain asymptomatic for many years and only become symptomatic when to the lesion compresses vital structures.
Pulmonary lymphangioma typically requires a surgical excision. Surgery or sclerotherapy are potential treatment options. Incomplete resection, or sclerotherapy can result in the recurrence of the lymphangioma with patient’s symptoms.

He has a history of mercury vapor inhalation at the home one day before ER admission. He burned 40 sheets of amulets in the confined space and the mercury is one of the ingredient of ink which is use for the letter of amulets. The serum mercury level was 54.6 microgram/L and his symptom had relieved after using steroid and radiologic abnormalities were reversible and resolved during the follow up.
","Mostly mercury poisoning occurs in workers exposed to mercury vapors over a long perioid of time: fur or felt hat-making, dental profession, extract gold from mercury amalgam or accidents within the home and the symptom includes gingivitis, stomatitis, fine tremor and irritability. However, rarely acute mercury poisoning could happen and lung appears to be primarily affected in the case of acute exposure to metallic mercury vapor causing chemical pneumonitis. 
The major radiographic abnormalities are diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates or consolidation. The early CT findings are ground glass opacity, alveolar consolidation and ill definedcentrilobular nodules. In mild cases, scattered, ill defined nodular opacities are dominant. In more severe cases, patchy areas of ground glass opacity and consolidation, predominantly in the subpleural region and in the upper to mild lung zones, are seen. In the most severely affected cases, all lung zones are involved. 
Postmortem studies have shown severe damage to the bronchi and bronchioles with marked alveolar edema. In the presence of marked necrosis, complications such as interstitial emphysema, pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax can occur.
Most of the interstitial changes are inflammatory edema and are reversible, especially when exposure is relatively mild. But mercury apparently persists in lung tissue for several months which could be significantly related to the interstitial fibrosis.

Lung setting image of chest CT (Fig. 2 and 3) shows subpleural dot like and branching opacities, reticular densities and bronchiolectasis in both lower subpleural portions. Mediastinal setting images of non-contrast enhanced chest CT (Fig 4 and 5) show thin noncalcified pleural plaques in both hemithoraces.","Asbestosis is diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis that occurs secondary to inhalation of asbestos fibers. It is considered separately from other asbestos-related diseases, such as benign pleural effusion and plaques, malignant mesothelioma, and bronchogenic carcinoma.
Asbestosis manifests with the same clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features as other forms of diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Asbestosis may be diagnosed without lung biopsy in the presence of three clinical signs (ie, a restrictive pattern of lung impairment, a diffusion capacity below the lower limit of the normal range, and bilateral crackles at the posterior lung base in the latter part of or throughout the respiratory cycle); a history of relevant exposure; and, most important, chest radiographic findings that correspond to ILO classification.
On chest radiographs asbestosis shows small, irregular or reticular opacities, predominantly in the bases of the lungs. The opacities may progressively spread through the middle and upper lung zones. In more advanced cases, honeycombing is evident on chest radiographs. And pleural thickening or pleural plaques may also be seen.
Chest CT is much more sensitive than chest radiograph in evaluating asbestosis. The earliest CT findings in asbestosis are subpleural dot-like or branching opacities located a few millimeters from the pleura but seldom touching the pleura, or they may appear as a fine branching structure. As the subpleural dot-like or branching opacities increase in number, confluence of dots creates subpleural curvilinear lines. Such lines are defined as linear areas of increased density located within 1 cm of the pleura and lying parallel to the inner chest wall on CT. Parenchymal bands are also commonly seen in asbestosis. The bands reflect the development of fibrosis along the bronchovascular sheathes or interlobular septa, with distortion of the lung parenchyma. And these bands are associated with areas of pleural plaques and frequently occur at the lung bases. Ground-glass opacity is uncommon as an isolated abnormality in asbestosis. GGO in asbestosis reflects mild alveolar wall and interlobular thickening caused by fibrosis or edema. As the pulmonary fibrosis extends from the peribronchiolar lesions to involve the residual pulmonary lobules, other characteristic CT findings of pulmonary fibrosis develop. These include intralobular interstitial thickening, interlobular septal thickening, traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis and honeycomb cysts in the lower lung, posterior, and basal subpleural areas.

Fig 2-3. chest CT scan shows about 4 cm irregular part-solid mass with cystic component in the RLL posterobasal segment.
Figs 4-5. There was no significant interval change on low-dose chest CT scan taken 6 months later.
Right lower lobectomy was done and placental mogrification was pathologically confirmed. 
","Placental transmogrification of the lung, or pulmonary placental transmogrification, is also referred to as placentoid bullous lesion. It is known to be a very rare disease with less than 30 adequately documented cases. Clinically, placental transmogrification usually occurs in men between 20 to 50 years old; however, our case was even a more rare case due to the occurrence in a female patient. It may be asymptomatic or perhaps associated with pneumothorax or chronic obstructive lung disease.
The etiology and pathogenesis still remain unclear. It may be congenital, but no placental transmogrification has been reported in children. Placental transmogrification is not only associated with cystic or emphysematous lung lesion, but also with pulmonary fibrochondromatoushamartomas and pulmonary lipomatosis. Thus, the radiologic presentation can be bullous change or pulmonary lung nodules.
Previous articles had classified the radiologic findings into 3 patterns. The most common manifestation is bullous emphysema pattern. Next, the disease is expressed on radiography with a mixed pattern of thin-walled cystic lesion and nodule. Rarely, the radiologic finding shows a solitary nodule pattern. The disease itself is a rare disease entity, and our case had even more unusual findings of both giant bulla and subsegmental consolidation patterns.
Radiologically, differential diagnosis of the lesion includes cystic or bullous lung disease, such as bullous emphysema, particularly giant bullous emphysema (vanishing lung syndrome), and solitary pulmonary lung nodules, such as hamartoma.
Bullous emphysema shows similar imaging characteristics to placental transmogrification. Placental transmogrification usually has a unilateral giant bullous change. However, bullous emphysema generally demonstrates a diffuse bilateral lung involvement. In addition, although bullous emphysema can have rapid progression of lung parenchyma destruction in drug abuse, acquired immune deficiency syndrome or autoimmune disease, it commonly affects old age with a history of smoking and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and develops over a long period of time. In particular, giant bullous emphysema is also referred to as primary bullous emphysema or vanishing lung syndrome, which is characterized by bulla occupying at least one third of the hemithorax. It may most closely resemble the image characteristics similar to placental transmogrification.
Other radiologic findings of placental transmogrification are emphysema with pulmonary nodules or solitary pulmonary nodule patterns. In rare cases, these solid pulmonary nodules contain air and fat. The radiologic differential diagnosis of the nodule includes pulmonary hamartoma. However, the image finding alone has limited value to differentiate the lesion from placental transmogrification. Therefore, making the diagnosis requires the confirmation of pathology.
In summary, the image finding of placental transmogrification presents unilateral large bullous emphysema with or without an associated nodule or consolidation. From a clinical standpoint, making an accurate preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Although it is an extremely rare disease, it must be ruled out in patients with unilateral bullous lesion who do not have high risk of bullous emphysema.

No cause was identified with no proceeding trauma or infection, and no past medical history. No mass or vascular malformation identified on imaging.  VATS was decided, and adhesion band, multiple bullae, and active bleeding were observed in OP finding. 
Haemothorax is a clinical entity that in most cases can be caused by trauma, coagulopathy, or iatrogenic causes through procedures such as central line insertion, thoracocentesis, pleural biopsies. Spontaneous haemothorax (SH) is a subcategory of haemothorax that involves the accumulation of blood within the pleural space in the absence of trauma or other causes. 
Spontaneous hemopneumothorax, defined as the accumulation of more than 400 mL of blood in the pleural cavity in association with spontaneous pneumothorax, is a rare entity occurring in young patients and may be life threatening. The clinical presentation is variable and includes a rapid progression of symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea that can be life threatening when hemodynamic instability and hypovolemic shock occurs.   
There are said to be three mechanisms of bleeding in hemopneumothorax.  First, result from a tom adhesion between the parietal and visceral pleura.  Second, result from the rupture of vascularized bullae and underlying lung parenchyma.  Third, result from torn congenitally aberrant vessels between the parietal pleura and bullae.
The diagnosis of spontaneous hemopneumothorax is concurrent presence of pneumothorax and hemothorax (over 50 HU fluid, blood-fluid level), absence of trauma or other causes. 
Thoracoscopic draining is usually for stable patients. In haemodynamically unstable patients or if the rate of bleeding is more than 500 mL/hr in the first hour with 200-300 mL/hr subsequently, early surgical approach is favoured.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1199-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1199-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1199-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1199-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1199-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1199-6.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1199-7.jpg']",73,"['correct:14/73', 'diff:2/73']"

These nodules are well-defined, round, and non-calcified. There are no enlarged lymph nodes, pleural effusion, or other relevant pulmonary changes. 
Enhanced abdominal CT images show multiple low-attenuating lesions in both hemilivers.
Upon 18F-FDG PET/CT examination, these pulmonary nodules show no remarkable accumulation of the tracer; however, a false negative result cannot be entirely excluded, due to the small size of the nodules. There is no lesion with abnormal increased FDG uptake in the scanned body.
The patient underwent VATS biopsy at the right lower lobe, and pulmonary nodules were confirmed as epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas.
","Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EH) is a rare vascular tumor, originating from vascular endothelial or pre-endothelial cells. This low- to intermediate-grade sarcoma may involve the liver alone (21%), liver and lung (18%), lung alone (12%), or bone alone (14%), and can be aggressive, even resulting in systemic metastasis. Pulmonary EH are four times more common in women than in men and are often detected incidentally. The prognosis is variable, and the 5-year survival probability is 60% (range: 47-71%). There is no established standard treatment of choice; Surgery and/or chemoradiation therapy could be considered, depending on intrathoracic tumor spread and systemic metastases.
Multiple discrete pulmonary nodules are the most common CT finding of pulmonary EH. The nodules range in size up to 2 cm, but most are less than 1 cm in diameter. On serial CT examinations, these lesions show little or no growth. In this form of pulmonary EH, differential diagnosis includes pulmonary metastases, miliary granulomatous infection, sarcoidosis, silicosis, and primary lung malignancy. Other findings of pulmonary EH include multiple reticulonodular opacities mimicking hematolymphangitic metastasis and diffuse infiltrative pleural thickening mimicking malignant pleural mesothelioma or diffuse pleural carcinomatosis. 
PET/CT findings can demonstrate increased FDG-uptake but usually are not a pivotal tool for the diagnosis, and a negative PET cannot exclude pulmonary EH. This false negative result is thought to be caused by the small size of the nodules, little FDG activity in the neoplasm, or low cellular density. 
In our case, a close follow-up with chest CT was planned. The patient still has no symptoms and has survived for 33 months following the initial diagnosis. On the last chest CT, previous nodules are similar or have slightly increased in size without measurable change.

Unlike for most other malignancies, application of FDG PET/CT is limited for RCC, mainly due to physiological excretion of FDG from the kidneys, which decreases contrast between renal lesions and normal tissue.

The primary amyloid light chain disease (with chronic inflammatory disorders). 
Primary systemic amyloidosis usually results in a reticulonodular pattern due to diffuse interstitial parenchymal involvement on radiograph. This appearance must be differentiated from the finding of increased reticular markings and prominent interlobular septa resulting from congestive failure due to cardiac amyloidosis.

There was no pleural effusion or enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. ,"Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is an uncommon and problematic pulmonary disease, complicating many other respiratory disorders, thought to affect ∼240000 people in Europe. The most common form of CPA is chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA), which untreated may progress to chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis. Less common manifestations include: Aspergillus nodule and single aspergilloma. All these entities are found in non-immunocompromised patients with prior or current lung disease. Subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (SAIA, formerly called chronic necrotising pulmonary aspergillosis) is a more rapidly progressive infection (<3 months) usually found in moderately immunocompromised patients, which should be managed as invasive aspergillosis. Recommendations of approach to the radiographic diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is the below; 

Recommended performing a chest computed tomographic (CT) scan is whenever there is a clinical suspicion for IPA regardless of chest radiograph results (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Routine use of contrast during a chest CT scan for a suspicion of IPA is not recommended (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Contrast is recommended when a nodule or a mass is close to a large vessel (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Suggested a follow-up chest CT scan is to assess the response of IPA to treatment after a minimum of 2 weeks of treatment; earlier assessment is indicated if the patient clinically deteriorates (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). When a nodule is close to a large vessel, more frequent monitoring may be required (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

On sputum culture, Rhizopus microspores (fungus) was detected.","Mucormycosis is an opportunistic infection caused by fungi of the class Zygomycetes, caused by fungal species in the genera Rhizopus, Lichtheimia, and Mucor. Risk factors for infection include diabetes (especially in the setting of diabetic ketoacidosis), hematologic malignancy, stem cell or solid organ transplantation, immunosuppression, graft-versus-host disease, and desferoxamine therapy.
Imaging findings are mostly nonspecific and include consolidation, nodules, masses, cavities, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. Findings suggestive of invasive fungal infection include the air crescent sign (a thin rim of air between the necrotic lung and the surrounding parenchyma) and the halo sign (consolidation with a rim of surrounding GGO). Relatively large size of halo indicates that mucormycosis results in greater pulmonary hemorrhage than other angioinvasive infections, such as Aspergillus infections, that typically have only a small halo around the nodules. The lesions had a peripheral predominance and some patients showed vascular cutoff sign.
Treatment for mucormycosis depends on antifungal agents, surgery, and control of predisposing conditions. Amphotericin B and, more recently, posaconazole are efficacious in the treatment of mucormycosis. Voriconazole is not effective, although it is effective in the treatment of aspergillosis.

","Crizotinib is an inhibitor of several receptor tyrosine kinases, including anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR, c-Met), and c-ros oncogene 1. It has been approved for the treatment of advanced ALK-positive non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in many countries. The development of complex renal cyst has been observed in seven (4%) patients as stated in the latest label of crizotinib published by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
On recent report, among 255 crizotinib-treated patients, 22%, 3%, and 2% had preexisting simple cysts, complex cysts, or both, respectively. At the 6-month tumor assessment, 9% of all patients had acquired new cysts, and 2% of patients with preexisting cysts had developed new cysts and enlargements (>50%) of preexisting simple cysts. Asians appeared to have an increased risk of developing new cysts on treatment; Koreans in particular had 5.18 times higher odds of developing cysts than non-Asians.
The mechanisms by which crizotinib may increase the risk of developing renal cysts are currently unknown.
In all cases, no evidence of renal malignancy was found based on diagnostic testing (including follow-up with imaging scans) or clinical follow-up in any of the crizotinib-treated patients diagnosed with complex renal cysts.
Patients who developed renal cysts generally did not require dose reductions, and no patients required permanent discontinuation of crizotinib treatment due to this adverse effect. In some cases, this led to cystic invasion into adjacent tissue requiring drainage. While close monitoring is recommended, dosing modification was not generally necessary, allowing patients to continue to benefit from crizotinib treatment.

Fig 2-6. CT images show diffuse and bilateral ground glass opacity lesions and multiple thin walled and well-demarcated cysts in both lungs. 
","The lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is a rare disease characterized by diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells within the lung parenchyma. In the adult population, it most commonly affects middle age women, frequently occurring in patients with Sjögren syndrome, autoimmune thyroid disease, myasthenia gravis, and pernicious anemia. One-third of adult cases of LIP is associated with Sjögren Syndrome. 
The thorax is more frequently involved in SLE than in any other collagen vascular disease. The majority of patients with SLE have thoracic involvement at some time during their clinical course. Pleural and pericardial disease are the most common thoracic manifestations. Infectious pneumonia, lupus pneumonitis, alveolar hemorrhage, chronic interstitial pneumonitis/fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, thromboembolism, bronchiolitis obliterans, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, and diaphragmatic muscle dysfunction have been described. Although there has been prior association between SLE and pulmonary lymphoma, LIP is distinctly uncommon in SLE. The majority of patients with SLE will develop thoracic involvement at some point in their disease. This is most frequently pleural and pericardial disease. LIP, although commonly associated with autoimmune disease, is rarely seen in patients with SLE.  
Reflecting diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, HRCT usually reveals thickening of perilymphatic interstitium, ground-glass opacity, and poorly defined centrilobular nodules. Furthermore, multiple variable sized thin-walled cystic airspaces are common finding, and should be good differential point from other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. Other findings include lymph node enlargement (in about 50% of cases) and bronchiectasis.
Definite diagnosis can be made with lung biopsy. Although there is no standard treatment for LIP, steroid therapy is commonly used and other immunosuppressive drugs may be combined. 
Prognosis is variable, and can be grave. Therefore, keen radiologic suspicion and early diagnosis is crucial.

","Relapsing polychondritis is a rare multisystem inflammatory disease characterized by repeated episodes of inflammation and progressive destruction of cartilages.
Respiratory involvement is seen at presentation of disease in about 10 % and during the course of the disease in about 50% of the patients. Laryngeal and tracheobronchial cartilages can be involved, causing hoarseness or dyspnea. Recurrent inflammation may result in permanent airway stenosis, which can cause respiratory failure. Typical image finding is smooth airway wall thickening with increased attenuation, sparing the posterior membranous portion of the large airways. Other findings include wall calcification, luminal narrowing, and dynamic collapse of the airways as well as lobar air trapping.

The amylase and lipase was elevated in the aspirated fluid (1283/700).","Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common complication of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. They are usually located in peripancreatic area and very rarely may reach the mediastinum. 
Patho-physiologically, mediastinal pseudocyst can develop after rupture of the pancreatic duct into the retroperitoneal space. The pancreatic fluid then tracks through the diaphragmatic openings such as esophageal and aortic hiatus into the mediastinum. 
Symptoms are primarily the results of compression or invasion of the mediastinal structures and may include dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, abdominal, chest and/or back pain, dyspnea, and cough. 
A chest radiograph may be of low diagnostic yield, but may show retrocardiac opacity, pleural effusion, and atelectasis of basal lungs. Contrast-enhanced CT scan can show a thin-walled low-attenuating cystic mass extended from the pancreas into the mediastinum. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography can help identify the connection between the mediastinal and abdominal pseudocyst in cases where it not so evident on CT scan. Endoscopic ultrasound is increasingly used in evaluating pancreatic cysts due to its advantages in delineating contents and wall of the cysts. 
An elevated amylase or lipase level in the aspirated fluid from the mediastinal pseudocyst can confirm the diagnosis. 
Spontaneous regression of mediastinal pseudocysts is rare and therapeutic intervention is frequently required. It includes surgical drainage such as open laparotomy and percutaneous approach, and endoscopic drainage methods. 
Pseudocysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mediastinal masses in patents with a history of pancreatitis.

","MALT lymphoma is a monoclonal lymphoid proliferation arising from a B-cell progenitor within bronchial associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), and is classified as low-grade marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Radiography shows nodules, masses, and/or consolidation. CT shows multiple nodules, masses, and/or nodular/mass-like areas of ground-glass attenuation or consolidation, which tend to be in a bronchovascular distribution and often show air bronchogram. Halo of ground-glass shadowing or peribronchovascular thickening at tumor margins, and discrete patches of ground glass shadowing, positive angiogram sign on contrast enhanced CT can also be seen. Slowly progressive pulmonary consolidation in conjunction with a supportive history of autoimmune disease or lymphoma in another mucosal site should strongly suggest the diagnosis of MALT lymphoma. MALT lymphoma lesions are hypermetabolic at PET/CT approximately half of the time. 
Treatment is usually with chemotherapy or immunotherapy (rituximab). Surgery and radiation therapy are options available for localized disease. The prognosis is good, with 5- and 10-year survival rates ranging from 84% to 88%.

The patient showed skin rash as shown as figure, and serum IgM of Varicella-zoster was positive. After treating with IV acyclovir 10mg/kg for 4 days and PO gangiclovir for 3 days, symptom and chest plain radiograph of the patient was much improved.
","Varicella virus (varicella-zoster virus) is a double-stranded DNA virus and a member of the Herpesviridae family. Varicella (chickenpox) is a common contagious infection in childhood, with increasing frequency in adults . Pneumonia, although rare, is the most serious complication affecting adults with chickenpox. Varicella pneumonia is estimated to occur in one of every 400 cases of adulthood chickenpox infections, being more common in pregnant and immunosuppressed patients .
Predisposing conditions include underlying leukemia and lymphoma and other causes of immunodeficiency. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with chickenpox are at high risk for developing varicella pneumonia .
Symptoms of pneumonia develop within a few days after the skin rash appears and include cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, cyanosis, and fever. Analysis of case series suggests that mortality due to varicella pneumonia has declined with the advent of acyclovir, although it remains as high as 22% in immunocompromised hosts.
The thin-section CT appearances in varicella pneumonia largely reflect the multicentric hemorrhage and necrosis centered on airways . Common findings include numerous nodular opacities measuring 5–10 mm in diameter, some with a surrounding halo of ground-glass opacity (halo sign), patchy ground-glass opacities, and coalescence of nodules . A miliary distribution may also occur. After antiviral chemotherapy, imaging findings disappear concurrently with healing of skin lesions.

On follow-up chest radiograph taken 5 days later revealed increase in size of preexisting lesions and a newly appeared consolidation with bilateral pleural effusions. On bronchoscopic biopsy, mucormycosis was confirmed. ","Pulmonary mucormycosis is a relatively rare and often fatal opportunistic infection caused by fungi of the class Zygomycetes, order Mucorales. The main risk factors are diabetes, hematologic malignancy, renal insufficiency, organ transplantation, and metabolic acidosis. It most commonly involves the sinuses, lungs, and skin.


Angioinvasion of fungi may cause thrombosis of pulmonary vessels and parenchymal necrosis. Radiologic findings of consolidation, solitary or multiple nodules with or without cavitation, halo or reversed-halo sign, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy are shown, mostly nonspecific.
It is important to distinguish mucormycosis from aspergillosis, because the treatments can differ and appropriate early treatment of mucormycosis may improve the outcome. The reverse halo sign was more common and airway-invasive features were less common in patients with pulmonary mucormycosis than in those with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

Contrast enhanced axial chest CT scan shows arterial supply from thoracic aorta and enlarged draining right pulmonary vein in basal segment of LLL and mild interlobular and intralobular septal thickening in LLL with GGO, suggesting an area of relative hypervascularity and/or intra-alveolar hemorrhage.
","Systemic arterialization of the lung without pulmonary sequestration is the rarest form of anomalous systemic arterial supply to the lung. This condition is characterized by an aberrant arterial branch arising from the aorta which supplies an area of lung parenchyma with normal bronchopulmonary anatomy.
The basal segments of left lower lobe are the most commonly affected site, although rarely other sites can be affected. The systemic artery most commonly arises from the thoracic aorta, but can arise from abdominal aorta or celiac axis and even more rarely from left subclavian and internal mammary artery.
Most patients are asymptomatic. The most common symptom is hemoptysis. Other manifestations include exertional dyspnea, murmur.
A retrocardiac tubular structure or a focal area of consolidation may be evident on chest X-Ray. Computed tomography may reveal a focal area of ground glass density, indicating an area of relative hypervascularity and/or intra-alveolar hemorrhage. CT can also demonstrate an aberrant systemic arterial supply to part of the lung. Thoracic CT is the most useful test in the evaluation of patients with suspected abnormal systemic arterial supply to the lung, as it demonstrates both the bronchial and vascular anatomy of the lung. CT angiography can clearly depict the origin of the aberrant systemic artery. MRI has also been reported to be useful in identifying an anomalous vessel originating from the aorta. 
The radiological differential diagnoses include true sequestration and, less likely, hypogenetic lung syndrome. On plain radiograph, intralobar sequestration usually manifests as an intrapulmonary lesion in the left lower lobe. Extralobar sequestration commonly appears as a single, well-defined homogenous opacity located in the pleural space between the left lower lobe and the diaphragm. Evidence of a homogenous or heterogeneous lung mass supplied by a systemic arterial branch on CT should raise suspicion of lung sequestration. MRI can be useful to differentiate the cystic, solid, hemorrhagic and mucous components of the lung mass, as well as providing details of the venous drainage and the abnormal systemic artery. On the other hand, hypogenetic lung syndrome is associated with volume loss of the right lung, which is usually evident on chest X-Ray. CT angiography and MRI reveal the typical vascular abnormalities of this rare condition.
Treatment options include surgery (lobectomy and segmentectomy), when aberrant systemic artery is the only supply, and occlusion of the aberrant vessel by surgical ligation or endovascular treatment.

Clinical Presentation
The patient visited our emergency department because of cough, dyspnea and hemoptysis, which have been aggravated for last 5 days. She was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis 5 years ago, but she stopped taking medication 2 years ago. Initial laboratory tests revealed severe anemia (hemoglobin: 5.7 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (79  109/L), and elevation of serum CRP (135.8 mg/L) and creatinine (4.8 mg/dL) with proteinuria (280 mg/dL) and hematuria (3+).



","Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a potentially catastrophic pulmonary complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) associated with a high mortality rate. DAH has been reported to complicate 2–5% of all cases of SLE. DAH is typically defined by the presence of three major components: (1) signs (bronchoscopy with bloody return) or symptoms (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis) of pulmonary hemorrhage, (2) drop of hemoglobin (typically 1.5–2 g/dL) and (3) new onset of diffuse infiltrates on chest imaging. Lupus nephritis has frequently been linked to DAH, with evidence of active kidney disease in patients with lupus DAH.
The pathophysiology of DAH is not well understood, suggested theories postulate immune-mediated alveolar capillary endothelial damage and inflammation that would result in local or diffuse bleeding from those capillaries. Imaging studies are commonly consistent with unexplained new consolidation and ground-glass opacity, usually diffuse but can be seen in the perihilar regions, while apices are spared. 
As with most organ-threatening manifestations of SLE, cyclophosphamide has been the mainstay of therapy for DAH, albeit in association with poor outcomes, which probably reflect its preferential use in the most critically ill patients. Other reported therapies include plasmapheresis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil, recombinant factor VII, and stem cell transplantation. However, the evidence to support any particular therapy is not strong.

","Pulmonary paragonimiasis is a parasitic infection caused by flukes of genus Paragonimus. This disease is caused by ingestion of a raw or undercooked freshwater crabs or crayfish infected with the metacercaria or by drinking contaminated water. 
The most common symptoms are intermittent hemoptysis or blood-tinged sputum and cough.
After ingested by humans, Paragonimus excyst in the small intestine, and the larvae penetrate through intestinal wall to gain access to the peritoneal cavity. Several weeks later, the organism travels through the diaphragm on its way to the pleural space. Next they enter the lung, where they mature to adult flukes and produce cysts that contain eggs. Paragonimiasis typically results in single of multiple 1- to 4-cm cystic spaces containing reddish brown mucinous fluid. When erosion occurs into a draining airways, the contents of the cyst may be coughed up or may spread to other portions of the lung parenchyma and result is exudative or hemorrhagic pneumonia. The imaging manifestations of disease parallel to the life cycle of the parasites.

","The CT diagnosis of SVC thrombosis includes a lack of enhancement of the SVC, intraluminal filling defects or narrowing, and visualization of the collateral vessels. The presence of these collateral vessels is an important CT feature for the diagnosis of SVC obstruction, with a reported sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 92%, respectively.
When SVC obstruction occurs, blood is diverted via several collateral vessels. Four classic collateral vessel pathways are commonly described, including the anterior and lateral group, the mediastinal group, the azygos and hemiazygos pathways, and the vertebral group. In fact, several collateral pathways are commonly involved, and the specific pattern depends on the cause and exact location of the obstruction and on the many individual variations in the venous anatomy. It is very difficult to predict the pattern of collateralization on the basis of the characteristics of the SVC thrombosis. Similarly, poor correlation between patient symptoms and the pattern of collateralization has been observed. In some reports, the azygos and vertebral collateral venous systems were enhanced. However, the anterior and lateral and mediastinal collateral venous pathways were also very frequently enhanced.
The paravertebral venous plexus is a small network of veins within and surrounding the vertebrae. It includes the epidural vertebral venous plexuses, external vertebral venous plexuses, basivertebral veins, and intervertebral veins. The internal portion of the plexus, the so-called venous plexus of Batson, is epidural and receives blood from the vertebral bodies via the basivertebral veins. It freely communicates with the external paravertebral venous plexuses via the intervertebral veins that pass through the spinal foramina. This paravertebral plexus constitutes several anastomoses, including the brachiocephalic, azygos, hemiazygos system, renal veins, and inferior vena cava. The epidural plexuses are located within the vertebral canal and run in a vertical direction. They can be divided into the anterior and posterior epidural plexuses, with high levels of anteroposterior communication achieved by means of multiple intervertebral veins. The external vertebral venous plexuses are divided into the ventral and dorsal plexuses by the transverse processes. The basivertebral vein enters the vertebral body and opens into the epidural venous plexus, whereas the intervertebral plexuses are located near the spinal nerves in the intervertebral foramen.

In fact, the patient was amateur marathoner who runs about 100 km a week. First CT scan demonstrated patchy consolidation and GGO in the LLL posterior basal segment. Bronchoscopy showed focal bleeding at the LB 10 (posterior basal segmental bronchus) at that time. Five years later, the patient underwent additional CT scan for evaluating his hemoptysis, CT demonstrated new, ill-defined geographic GGO in BULs. These lesions were disappeared on the last CT image which was took three years later, and another geographic GGO newly demonstrated in BUL, especially RUL. Considering the image findings and clinical aspects together, it was possible to assume that the patient's symptoms and images were caused by severe exercise.","Exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) or exercise-induced pulmonary edema (EIPE) have frequently been documented in racehorses, however, EIPH/EIPE have also been often described with hard aerobic exercise in humans including marathon runners, triathletes, cyclists, and swimmers. EIPH may presented with a variety of clinical symptoms, including asymptomatic patients, cough, dyspnea, blood-tinged sputum, hemoptysis, or epistaxis after extreme exercise.
Capillary wall tearing was one of the pathogenesis explaining the disease. Exercise elevates pulmonary capillary pressures and can affect the integrity of the blood-gas barrier. With extreme exertion, these changes result in increased permeability and cause bleeding into the lung.
Recent histological studies identified extensive remodeling of small pulmonary veins in EIPH/EIPE-affected horse lungs. Strenuous exercise results in high pulmonary vascular pressure and high vascular pressure results in pulmonary vein wall remodeling. Those lesions lead to diminished vein lumen diameter and during hard exercise, venous occlusion induces regionally increased pulmonary capillary pressure, capillary rupture and bleeding.
Imaging findings are non-specific and may appear in the form of pulmonary hemorrhage or pulmonary edema. The bronchoscopic evaluation, including the bronchoalveolar lavage can help with diagnosis.

VATS wedge resection was done in the right lower lobe. Pathologic findings were acute and chronic inflammation with eosinophilic infiltration in the interstitium and intraalveolar areas with fibrosis.
Steroid treatment was started and then taken FU CXR after 3months shows almost regression.
","CEP is an idiopathic condition characterized by chronic and progressive clinical features and an abnormal, marked accumulation of eosinophils in the interstitium and alveolar spaces of the lung. The clinical manifestation is usually insidious, and the patient experiences symptoms for an average of 7.7 months before the diagnosis is made. Most patients are middle aged, and approximately 50% have asthma. Women are more frequently affected than men. Pulmonary function tests can be normal in mild cases but usually show restrictive defects.

CT demonstrates typical nonsegmental areas of airspace consolidation
with peripheral predominance. Less common findings include ground-glass
opacities, nodules, and reticulation. CT performed more than 2months after the onset of symptoms shows linear band-like opacities parallel to the pleural surface, whereas in Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia(COP), consolidation involving subpleural and peribronchial areas was the most common finding with somewhat lower lobar dominancy.

","Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), also known as inflammatory pseudotumor, is a rare tumor with unknown etiology. It can involve many anatomic sites and most commonly affects the lung. 
It affects predominantly younger population, and it is the most common lung tumor in children and adolescents. It is rarely seen in adults constituting 0.7% of adult lung tumor. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific. Up to 70% of patients are asymptomatic. Frequent symptoms may vary from cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis and weight loss.
Histologically, it is composed of fibrous tissues, myofibroblastic spindle cells and inflammatory cell proliferation. Although it usually show indolent clinical course, sarcomatous transformation has been described. And occasionally, it may show an aggressive behavior with local invasion and metastasis.
Radiologically, pulmonary IMT is frequently seen as a peripherally located solitary pulmonary nodule or mass. It may have lobulated contours and show varying degrees of heterogeneous enhancement on CT. It rarely manifest as a consolidative mass and cavitation may observed within a mass or consolidation. About 15% of IMTs show calcification. On PET, it usually shows high uptake indicating a high degree of metabolic activity.
Surgical resection is treatment of choice for accurate diagnosis and long term survival benefit. Chemotherapeutic agents may have little or no effect. In cases of tumor where ALK is positive on immunohistochemical staining, crizotinib can be used. Steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs have shown some benefit in cases where metastasis to bones and other distant organs.

The patient underwent CT-guided biopsy of the lung, which showed inconclusive results. The patient then underwent lobectomy of the right middle lobe, which revealed the mass to be sclerosing pneumocytoma surrounded by diffuse intraalveolar hemorrhage. 
","Pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytomas (PSP), previously known as pulmonary sclerosing hemangiomas, are rare benign neoplasms of the lung. It typically presents in middle age (mean age of 46 years), with female predilection. Most patients are asymptomatic. Symptoms, if present, include hemoptysis, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and pleurisy. The lesions range from 0.8 to 8.2 cm in diameter, but most are less than 3 cm in diameter. 
Histologically, PSPs show proliferation of type 2 pneumocytes, consisting of four major histologic components: solid, papillary, sclerotic, and hemangiomatous.
PSPs typically presents on chest radiograph as a solitary, well-defined oval to rounded nodular lesion. On CT, PSPs show a smoothly marginated, homogeneously enhancing, round or oval nodule/mass with foci of calcification and air meniscus. Differentiation from lung cancer may be difficult on CT. A recent study reported that PSPs most likely present with a signle lesion (92.1%) and have smooth boundary (65.8%) and an oval shape (65.8%), with a mean diameter of 2.27 cm. Four key CT signs are marginal pseudocapsule sign (50%), overlying vessel sign (26.3%), air-gap sign (2.6%), and rarely, halo sign (17.1%).

","Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) refers to a constellation of granulomatous, interstitial, bronchiolar, and alveolar filling pulmonary diseases caused by repeated exposure and sensitization to a variety of organic and chemical antigens. Early recognition of the disease and prevention of long term antigen exposure are necessary to avoid progression to irreversible fibrosis.
HP traditionally has been classified as manifesting in three phases: acute, subacute, and chronic. Subacute HP is caused by intermittent or continuous exposure to low doses of antigen. The symptoms may appear gradually over weeks or months. Patients usually present with exertional dyspnea and cough.
Chest radiographs obtained in many patients with HP are normal. Abnormal radiographic findings observed in some patients include numerous poorly defined small (less than 5 mm) opacities throughout both lungs, sometimes with sparing of the apices and bases. Airspace disease is represented often as GGO (which can be patchy or diffuse, resembling pulmonary edema) or, more rarely, as consolidation.
HRCT has greatly improved the radiologic diagnosis of HP: abnormalities are seen in more than 90% of patients. Typical findings of subacute HP include patchy bilateral GGO and small ill-defined centrilobular nodules. Another common manifestation of subacute HP is the presence of focal areas of decreased attenuation on inspiratory HRCT, air trapping on expiratory HRCT, or both. These areas usually have sharply defined margins and a configuration consistent with involvement of single or multiple adjacent pulmonary lobules.
In the presence of a history of exposure and consistent clinical and radiologic findings, the diagnosis of HP can be confirmed by visualization of increased numbers of lymphocytes in BAL fluid and occasionally by findings at transbronchial biopsy. 
Most cases of HP, whether acute or insidious, include the following four histologic features in variable amounts and combinations: cellular bronchiolitis, diffuse chronic interstitial inflammatory infiltrates (primarily consisting of lymphocytes and plasma cells), and poorly circumscribed interstitial nonnecrotizing (noncaseating) granulomas.

The differential diagnosis should also include a miliary granulomatous infection, Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis, hematogenous metastasis and multiple atypical adenomatous hyperplasia/adenocarcinoma in situ. The presence of multiple tiny pulmonary nodules in a random distribution in a TSC patient should suggest the presence of MMPH.
 The clinical manifestations resulting from isolated MMPH are dyspnea, cough, and mild to moderate hypoxemia. The clinical course of MMPH is usually not progressive and treatment is unnecessary.

","Pulmonary paragonimiasis is a food-borne parasitic disease caused by the lung fluke Paragonimus westermani, which is endemic in Southeast Asia and the Far East. 
The most common symptoms are intermittent hemoptysis or blood-tinged sputum and cough.
After ingested by humans, Paragonimus excyst in the small intestine, and the larvae penetrate through intestinal wall to gain access to the peritoneal cavity. Several weeks later, the organism travels through the diaphragm on its way to the pleural space. Next they enter the lung, where they mature to adult flukes and produce cysts that contain eggs. Paragonimiasis typically results in single of multiple 1- to 4-cm cystic spaces containing reddish brown mucinous fluid. When erosion occurs into a draining airways, the contents of the cyst may be coughed up or may spread to other portions of the lung parenchyma and result is exudative or hemorrhagic pneumonia. 
The imaging manifestations of disease parallel to the life cycle of the parasites. The characteristic CT features of pulmonary paragonimiasis are round low attenuation cystic lesions filled with fluid or gas. CT scan also showed air-space consolidation, nodules, worm migration track, and bronchiectasis. The prevalence of pleural effusion varies.

","DIP is an uncommon form of interstitial pneumonia that occurs frequently in patients between 30 and 50 years of age. Approximately 90% of patients with DIP are cigarette smokers. Most cases of DIP are currently considered to represent a reaction to cigarette smoke. The DIP is characterized histologically by the presence of numerous macrophages within alveolar airspaces. Unlike usual interstitial pneumonia, DIP involvement is typically more or less uniform in severity within affected lobules. Interstitial inflammation and fibrosis are usually mild but may be moderate or rarely severe. Similarly, architectural distortions of lung parenchyma and traction bronchiectasis are uncommon features. 
 The most common radiographic appearance of DIP is bilateral basal hazy increased opacification with a reduction in lung volumes. However, the radiographs are normal in about 5% to 20% of patients who have biopsy-proven DIP. The predominant HRCT abnormality is also bilateral area of ground-glass attenuation, reflecting the filling of alveolar airspaces by macrophages. A subpleural and basal predominance is often present. Although reticular opacity may be associated with ground-glass attenuation, honeycombing is uncommon. Of cases, 32%-75% develop small cystic airspaces within areas of ground-glass attenuation. Histopathologic correlation suggests that some of these cysts represent bronchioliectasis and dilated alveolar ducts, without honeycomb fibrosis. Because of its association with cigarette smoking, centrilobular emphysema is also common present. Spontaneous improvement may occur in untreated patients. The response to corticosteroid is unclear; however, most patients report a symptomatic improvement.

The CT scans demonstrated central GGOs with a surrounding irregular rim of consolidation (reversed halo sign) in left lingular segment. This lesion has extended to the visceral pleura that is resulting in pleural thickening.
","Mucormycosis is an opportunistic fungal infection and it is caused by fungi of the order Mucorales in the class Zygomycetes. Mucormycosis is far less common than other opportunistic fungal infections including Aspergillus and Candida infections, although the mortality rate is much higher.
Infection is usually caused by inhalation of spores and the paranasal sinuses and lungs are most commonly affected. Pulmonary infection causes cough, fever, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain.
Risk factors for mucormycosis infection include diabetes, hematologic malignancy, stem cell or solid organ transplantations, immunosuppression, graft-versus-host disease, and desferoxamine therapy. At the time of diagnosis, only just under half of patients show neutropenic condition.
Clinical diagnosis of mucomycosis is challenging because the clinical features overlap with those of other infections and because of the lack of blood marker such as galactomannan and β-d-glucan. Definitive diagnosis often needs invasive sampling, which may delay treatment and is not always successful. Therefore, radiologic findings can play an important role in the diagnosis.
Imaging findings are mostly nonspecific and include consolidation, nodules, masses, cavities, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. Suggestive findings of invasive fungal infection include air crescent sign (a thin rim of air between the necrotic lung and the surrounding parenchyma) and the halo (consolidation with a rim of surrounding GGO, 53%). Mucormycosis is an aggressive angio-invasive infection that often leads to pulmonary infarction (more extensive and more rapid than Aspergillus infection). Mucormycosis can demonstrate as the “reverse halo” (or “reversed halo”) sign on CT, which describes a consolidation with central ground-glass (60-67%). In addition, the lesions commonly present the peripheral distribution (87%). According to Wahba et al., in immunocompromised patients, despite the lower prevalence of the reverse halo sign, it could be more predictive of mucormycosis than invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Nam et al. suggested initial CT scans of patients with mucormycosis commonly demonstrate consolidation or nodule/mass with halo sign, when patients had treatment and recovery of neutropenia, the majority of patients demonstrated sequential morphologic changes such as revere halo sign, central necrosis and air crescent sign, as similar features of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.
Treatment for mucormycosis depends on antifungal agents, surgery, and control of predisposing conditions. Amphotericin B and, more recently, posaconazole are efficacious in the treatment of mucormycosis. Voriconazole is not effective although it is effective in the treatment of aspergillosis.

Treatment of unilateral congenital pulmonary venous atresia may be conservative in relatively asymptomatic patients, and pneumonectomy is done in patients with progressive dyspnea, significant pneumonia, or recurrent pneumonia.

Differential diagnoses included solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura and neurogenic tumor. Wedge resection was performed (A). A well-capsulated whitish pleura mass with an approximate area of 4cm was excised (B), and the pathologic diagnosis was confirmed to be solitary fibrosis tumor of the pleura. 
","Accounting for less than 5% of all pleural tumors, solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura (SFTP) is a rare neoplasm that originates in submesothelial mesenchymal cells; 80% of these tumors arise from the visceral pleura. SFTP may occur in various parts of the body, including the head, neck, thorax, abdomen, and extremities; however, the most prevalent site of origin is the thoracic pleura. Less common SFTP sites in the thorax include the mediastinum, lung parenchyma, and soft tissues (1). SFTP demonstrates soft tissue attenuation on unenhanced CT scans and shows relatively homogeneous intense enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT scans. Magnetic resonance imaging typically visualizes SFTP with low-to-intermediate signal intensity on T1WI and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images, which is thought to be due to high cellularity and abundant collagen (2). Necrosis, myxoid degeneration, or hemorrhage within the tumor may also be observed in cases of SFTP, which causes heterogeneous attenuation on CT or high SI on T2WI (2, 3). On positron emission tomography, SFTP shows minimal-to-no fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (1). While SFTPs typically grow undetected for several years, they are usually benign and exhibit relatively indolent behavior. Its differential diagnosis is essentially similar to that of any mass lesion in the chest. A posterior paraspinal location might suggest a neurogenic tumor or round atelectasis. A more anterior and medial location might indicate a thymic neoplasm, germ cell tumor, or teratoma. The usually well-circumscribed appearance of the SFTP generally rules out malignant pleural mesothelioma (1). In the case of benign SFTP, complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice; the 10-year survival rate following surgical intervention is reported to be up to 98% (4). However, 12~37% of SFTPs are classified as malignant. The characteristic findings of malignant SFTP are masses with diameters of more than 10 cm, central necrosis, and ipsilateral pleural effusion. Metastasis reportedly recurs in 14~43% of cases of malignant SFTP, the 5-year survival rate after the treatment of which is 45-68% (5).","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1238-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1238-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1238-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1238-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1238-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1238-6.jpg']",67,"['correct:15/67', 'diff:19/67']"

","Identification of tracheobronchial mucormycosis is usually delayed and ultimately made via autopsy because of the nonspecific clinical presentations. However, serious complications do develop during mucormycosis because the pathogen invades the airways and hilar vessels which may result in atelectasis, abscess formation and hemorrhage.


Endobronchial involvement is a rare presentation of mucormycosis. Its lesions have been identified as gray-white mucoid materials that frequently block major airways, which are themselves often edematous and necrotic. CT scans of endobronchial mucormycosis showed luminal narrowing and wall thickening of the mid- or distal trachea and bronchi, variably sized mediastinal lymph nodes, nonspecific pulmonary opacities, and a large lung abscess. Also identified were intramural air collections within the thickened bronchial wall, nonenhancing low attenuation thickening of the bronchial wall, and bronchonodal fistula. 


In a previous study of 12 mucormycosis cases, 95% of patients had immunosuppressive diseases such as Diabetes mellitus with or without ketoacidosis, corticosteroid therapy, and renal insufficiency. A majority of pathological diagnoses were made via a transbronchial biopsy (76.7%). However, bronchoscopic biopsy itself can be catastrophic owing to the high risk of fatal hemorrhage. In conclusion, tracheobronchial mucormycosis is a rare but severe disease with high mortality due to nonspecific clinical presentations and variable predisposing factors.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1241-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1241-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1241-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1241-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1241-5.jpg']",62,"['correct:1/62', 'diff:22/62']"

Mild right pleural thickening is also seen (figure 1). 
On initial thin-section chest CT scans, relatively diffuse ground-glass opacities and poorly defined centrilobular micronodules are noted in both lungs (figure 2, 3). There is also reticulation with thickening of the intralobular lines and interlobular septae associated with mild traction bronchiolectasis in the subpleural areas of both basal lungs.
Four years later, follow-up chest radiography shows the progression of diffuse interstitial thickening with reticular opacities in both lungs. There are newly appeared airspace consolidations in the left lower lung, as well as mild mediastinal widening with increased opacity and left pleural effusion (figure 4). Chest CT lung window scan shows further progress and increased coarseness of reticulation in the subpleural areas of both basal lungs (figure 5, 6). There are newly appeared airspace consolidations as well as large nodules and diffuse thickening of the bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septae in the left lung. Conglomerated lymphadenopathy is newly noted at the left supraclavicular (figure 7), as well as the mediastinal and left axillary (figure 8) areas. A small amount of pleural effusion is also seen in the left lung. 
An open lung biopsy was performed at the initial presentation and the case was histopathologically diagnosed as lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP). 
Four years later, malignant lymphoma (T-cell/histiocyte rich large B-cell type) was diagnosed using a bone marrow biopsy and excision biopsy of the left axillary lymph nodes. 


","Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by diffuse proliferation of polyclonal lymphocytes and plasma cells in the pulmonary parenchymal interstitium, with lymphoid follicles and germinal centers. It may be associated with a variety of autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders including Sjögren’s disease, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multicentric Castleman’s disease and HIV infection. LIP is substantially more common in women, and most commonly presents in the fourth to seventh decades. Dyspnea and a nonproductive cough are common and may be present for months to years. PFTs often show restrictive patterns depending on the progression of the disease. 

Sjögren’s disease is characterized by both dryness in the mouth and eyes as well as lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary glands, which are easily accessible and thus facilitate diagnosis. The disease can extend beyond the exocrine glands, resulting in systemic manifestations such as vasculitis, lung, renal or neurological involvement. Sjögren’s disease is also known to increase the risk of lymphoma in patients. 

LIP occurring specifically in Sjögren’s disease patients is characterized by ground-glass abnormalities due to homogenous lymphocytic infiltration. Since LIP is a hyperplastic disorder of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, it lies on a disease spectrum from follicular bronchiolitis to lymphoma. CT findings of LIP include ground-glass opacity, poorly defined centrilobular nodules, bronchovascular thickening, and septal thickening. Discrete lung cysts measuring 5-30 mm are often present and are ascribed to bronchiolar obstruction with lymphocytic wall infiltration. Such cysts are helpful in distinguishing LIP from malignant lymphoma, which should be suspected in the case of airspace consolidations, large nodules (>1cm), or pleural effusions. 

The lymphoproliferative disorders in Sjögren’s disease can develop as part of a multi-step process in which polycolonality is followed by monoclonality and t(14;18) chromosomal translocation. Previous study reported a 30% rate of progression from LIP to malignant lymphoma. This case shows a patient with Sjögren’s disease and initial presentation of LIP who eventually developed malignant lymphoma during the course of their hospitalization.

Outward symptoms most often consist of an insidious onset of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. The classic appearance of Pneumocystis pneumonia in chest radiographs is bilateral perihilar or diffuse symmetric opacities, which may be finely granular, reticular, or ground-glass in appearance. The classic CT finding in Pneumocystis pneumonia cases is extensive ground-glass opacity, which is attributable to the presence of intraalveolar exudate consisting of surfactant, fibrin, cellular debris, and organisms.

In particular, diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis is caused by lymphangiomas limited to the thorax. The onset of the disease is insidious, and its clinical presentations are nonspecific (e.g., dyspnea, cough, chest pain, milky sputum, fever, shortness of breath, and wheezing); thus, diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis is often misdiagnosed as other chronic respiratory disease. Though pathologic analysis is the main basis of diagnosis in diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis, it is extremely difficult to obtain satisfactory pathologic results in a clinical setting, which can be attributed to the method and site of biopsy as well as the size of the biopsy specimens.
MDCT after direct lymphangiography is well suited to the diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis because it is capable of clarifying the dilatation and proliferation of lymphatic channels to more clearly depict intrathoracic abnormalities. These abnormalities include abnormal distribution of contrast medium, dilatation of lymphatic channels, mediastinal soft-tissue infiltration, peribronchovascular thickening, interlobular septal thickening, diffuse ground-glass opacities, pleural effusion, extrapleural soft-tissue thickening, pericardial effusion and thickened pericardium, multiple lymphadenopathy in mediastinum, and mediastinal, pericardial, and thoracic aeroceles.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1244-1.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1244-2.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1244-3.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1244-4.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1244-5.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1244-6.JPG']",58,"['correct:25/58', 'diff:4/58', 'semi:3/58']"

","Invasive aspergillosis is a disease known to manifest mostly in immunocompromised hosts but also infrequently appears in immunocompetent individuals. It is an opportunistic airborne disease occurring predominantly in the lungs, although dissemination to virtually any organ is possible.
Early invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in CT radiography is often represented by segmental areas of consolidation or nodules with surrounding ground-glass opacities, corresponding to surrounding hemorrhage. After a patient has been treated, cavitation (the air crescent sign) may also develop within the pulmonary nodules.
Mediastinal invasion of aspergillosis is very uncommon and isolated lymphadenopathy is also very rare. Therefore, there are few studies on the image pattern of mediastinal invasion of or lymphadenopathy during aspergillosis and histopathological confirmation is essential.
Optimal management of aspergillosis involves early diagnosis and early initiation of antifungal therapy.

","Thoracic neurogenic tumors can originate from any nervous structure within the chest and are derived from cells of the autonomic ganglia, paraganglia or nerve sheath. The most common type of such nerve sheath tumors are Schwannomas, which originate from the spinal nerve root and extending along the intercostal nerve. Histologically, schwannomas consist of Schwann cells arranged in either a highly cellular distribution (Antoni A) or in a loose myxoid component (Antoni B), but both types may also be present in a single schwannoma.
Chest radiography of Schwannomas generally shows a smoothly marginated, oval paraspinal mass. In particular, contrast-enhanced CT shows a well-marginated paraspinal soft tissue mass with a possible “split fat” sign (fat attenuation around the soft-tissue mass). This is caused by displaced but intact surrounding fat covering the neuromuscular bundle, indicative of a non-filtrating underlying neurogenic mass. Schwannomas may also contain areas of low attenuation corresponding to fat or cystic degeneration. Calcification is seen in about 10% of Schwannoma cases, which may primarily be in a peripheral pattern, particularly in long-standing lesions with advanced degeneration. Osseous pressure erosion may also be present.
Meanwhile, MRI of Schwannomas cases shows low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images, high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and intense enhancement of solid components on gadolinium-enhanced imaging.

","Follicular bronchiolitis is a lymphoproliferative disease, usually of reactive and non-neoplastic etiology. It results mostly from hyperplasia of bronchial associated lymphoid tissue or BALT. It is more prominent in middle aged and elderly patients. Secondary causes include connective tissue disease, a state of immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, and infections. Regarding histopathology, follicular bronchiolitis demonstrates hyperplastic lymphoid follicles with reactive germinal center along bronchovascular bundles, narrowing or obliterating bronchiolar lumen. Such findings may show extension along the interlobular septa with sparing of the alveolar septa.  Immunohistochemistry of follicular bronchiolitis also shows CD20 and CD79a positivity with predominant B cell infiltrations within the peribronchial follicles.
With regards to the imaging of follicular bronchiolitis, chest X-rays are often negative in early cases. Lung hyperinflation due to air trapping, small nodules, reticular or reticulonodular infiltrations may be noted in moderate to severe cases. On HRCT, bilateral 1~3mm tiny centrilobular nodules with peribronchial distribution are commonly noted. Characteristically, nodules may demonstrate a fluffy tree-in-bud (or cotton-in-bud) appearance. Disease is limited to the airways and diffuse interstitial involvement is extremely rare. Treatment usually includes steroid and/or macrolide antibiotics for idiopathic cases, while removal of the causative antigen is the key to treatment of secondary cases.

• Persistent spontaneous pneumothorax
• Chemotherapy or radiotherapy (for lung cancer)
• Tuberculosis

BPF is a potentially life-threatening complication with an incidence of 0-9% and associated mortality of 16-23%. During the immediate postoperative period, the main cause of BPF is failure to obliterate the bronchial stump, whereas delayed BPF is usually due to infection or tumor recurrence at the stump. Half of all BPF occurs early, within the 1st postoperative week.

• Failure of the post-pneumonectomy space to fill with fluid
• Persistent or progressive ipsilateral pneumothorax• ≥ 2.0 cm drop in the air-fluid level (a decrease < 1.5 cm can be ignored unless associated with contralateral mediastinal shift).
• Persistent or progressive pneumomediastinum or subcutaneous emphysema; reappearance of air in a previously opaque pneumonectomy space.

Since Frankel et al. first described all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) syndrome, it has been regarded as a life-threatening complication following ATRA therapy. ATRA syndrome specifically occurs as a result of ATRA usage which can differentiate acute promyelocytic leukemia blasts (M3 in the French-American-British classification of acute myelocytic leukemia) into mature granulocytes. 

ATRA syndrome is characterized by fever, respiratory distress, pleural and pericardial effusion, weight gain, and pulmonary infiltrates noted on chest radiography which are also generally associated with an increasing WBC.

The pathophysiology of ATRA syndrome is not completely understood, but it is associated with the increased secretion of various cytokines, particularly interleukin-2, in a manner resembling capillary leak syndrome. The proposed mechanisms may involve changes in the cytokine secretion and adhesive qualities of AML cells during ATRA-induced differentiation.

The major radiographic abnormalities of ATRA syndrome are similar to typical features of cardiogenic pulmonary edema: these include cardiomegaly, vascular pedicle widening, ground-glass opacity, peribronchial cuffing, septal lines and pleural effusion. Nodules and consolidation can also occur. 

Due to the nonspecific nature of the aforementioned radiologic features, ATRA syndrome is usually impossible to differentiate from other diseases such as edema, pneumonia or leukemic infiltration without definite clinical history. However, in combination with relevant clinical history, early recognition and quick treatment of the ATRA syndrome can be achieved by withdrawing ATRA combination in conjunction with steroid use.

","The incidence of solitary cystic lung cancer is approximately 3.7% according to the International Early Lung and Cardiac Action Program. Early carcinoma occurring in association with small cystic airspaces in the lung parenchyma is often initially misinterpreted as inflammatory changes or infection, often leading to a delayed diagnosis. In practice, suspicion for cancer in the morphologic change of a cyst or pericystic nodule can help to make an early diagnosis of this disease. There are many theories about the formation mechanisms of solitary cystic lung cancer, such as the “check valve” effect, alveolar cavity fusion caused by alveolar wall destruction, and expectoration of necrotic tumor tissue.

A cyst is distinguished from a cavity based on a wall thickness of less than 4 mm. On CT images, four morphologic types of pericystic cancers were described by Mascalchi et al and Maki et al. Type I is that of a nodule abutting the external aspect of a lung cyst, whereas Type II is that of a nodule arising from the cyst wall and projecting into the cystic space, Type III is that of cyst wall thickening, and Type IV is that of a multicystic lesion that contains areas of soft tissue attenuation. CT features including GGO around the cyst, irregular margins, and gradual expansion of the cystic airspaces are also seen in the evolution of solitary cystic lung cancer.

The most common pathologic type of solitary cystic lung cancer is adenocarcinoma. Less common pathologic subtypes are squamous carcinoma, adenosquamous cell carcinoma, and pulmonary lymphoma.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1251-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1251-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1251-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1251-4.jpg']",65,"['correct:8/65', 'diff:11/65', 'semi:5/65']"

","Pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (PMEC) is an uncommon neoplasm of the lung and the most common salivary gland malignancy. PMEC is usually located in the lobar or segmental bronchi, usually accompanied by distal bronchial dilatation with mucoid impaction. Although it is most commonly identified in the head and neck, it can occur in many sites of the body, including the breasts, lungs, skin, and thymus. 
Clinically, PMEC occurs over a broad age range of 3–78 years with a peak age of diagnosis in the third and fourth decades. Although some studies have reported a male predominance, most reports fail to demonstrate a clear predilection regarding PMEC occurrence based on gender.
Symptoms primarily include bronchial irritation and obstruction, including cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, and postobstructive pneumonia.
Patchy areas of low density are usually observed in PMEC cases and the solid part of PMEC usually shows moderate or severe enhancement. Furthermore, on CT images, the central type of PMEC was characterized by limited nodules, and tumors' appearances included a circumferential or elevated soft tissue nodule with either a smooth, lobulated, or polypoid margin. Meanwhile, the hilar type usually manifested with nodules inside the lobar or segmental lumen, often accompanied by distal bronchial dilatation with mucoid impaction. Finally, the peripheral type was the least found type both in PMEC, and its lesions were all masses, originating from small bronchi.
PMEC is a low-grade malignancy, and therefore is mainly treated by surgical resection. The utility of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in these cases remains controversial.

Although HL and non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) may have overlapping imaging findings, HL is characterized by the presence of a discrete anterior mediastinal mass with a lobulated contour. The tumor most commonly demonstrates homogeneous soft-tissue attenuation, although large lymph node masses may demonstrate heterogeneity with complex low attenuation representing necrosis, hemorrhage, or cystic degeneration. 
Lymph nodes involved in NHL tend to be larger as compared with those in HL and have a predilection for noncontiguous or hematogenous spread to thoracic and distant nodal and extranodal sites. Large B-cell lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma are the most common subtypes, primarily involving the anterior mediastinum. Specifically, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas usually present large and lobulated anterior mediastinal masses and occur predominantly in young adults, while also often directly invading adjacent structures. Low attenuation areas of necrosis within the mass were seen in 50% and calcification in 5%.

The patient underwent video assisted thoracic surgery in the right lung and the final pathologic diagnosis was confirmed as lung infiltration of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells.
","Leukemias are hematologic malignancies characterized by the production of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytes) in the bone marrow. Depending on the type of abnormal cells that are produced, leukemias are classified as myeloid (also known as myelogenous or myeloblastic) or lymphoid (also known as lymphocytic or lymphoblastic). Originally characterized as acute or chronic based on life expectancy, leukemias are now characterized as acute or chronic according to cellular maturity. Immature poorly differentiated cells (blast cells) predominate in acute leukemias, whereas mature (but abnormal) cells predominate in chronic leukemias.
Lymphadenopathy is the most common manifestation of leukemia in the thorax. Leukemia also may involve the lungs, pleura, heart, bones, and soft tissues. CT findings of leukemic pulmonary infiltration are nonspecific; however, leukemic cells have a tendency to involve the perilymphatic interstitium, producing smooth or nodular thickening of the bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septa. Pleural and pericardial effusions in patients with leukemia are more likely to be benign than malignant. Richter transformation occurs in 2%–8% of patients with CLL and is defined as the development of an aggressive lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or much less commonly, Hodgkin lymphoma).","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1254-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1254-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1254-3.jpg']",56,[]

","DIP as pulmonary manifestation of autoimmune disease:
A review of 24 DIP cases (Japan) indicates that DIP may be associated with a high incidence of autoimmune disorders.
Mild to moderate increases in IgG were seen in 59% and IgE in 45%. Interestingly, positive findings for some kind of autoantibodies (e.g. ANA, RF, ribonucleoprotein, SS-A, centromere) or high serum levels of Ig G (1,700-4,440 mg/mL) were observed in 19 cases (79%) by our re-viewing 24 pathologically definite DIP cases. The association of organ-specific immunological diseases, elevated ANA, IgG and IgE levels and BAL eosinophilia/neutrophilia in DIP suggests that the pathogenesis is immunologically mediated with the participation of a type I allergic reaction to some kind of exogenous dust including cigarette smoke, or an immunologically altered state such as an autoimmune disorder. Other study reported, DIP may be one of pulmonary manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. 
(Our case, the test for autoimmune Ab or Ig was not done)

DIP is an uncommon form of interstitial pneumonia that occurs frequently in patients between 30 and 50 years of age. Approximately 90% of patients with DIP are cigarette smokers, but can occurs in nonsmokers (10~42%). The most common radiographic appearance of DIP is bilateral basal hazy increased opacification with a reduction in lung volumes. However, the radiographs are normal in about 5% to 20% of patients who have biopsy-proven DIP. The predominant HRCT abnormality is also bilateral area of ground-glass attenuation, reflecting the filling of alveolar airspaces by macrophages. A subpleural and basal predominance is often present. Although reticular opacity may be associated with ground-glass attenuation, honeycombing is uncommon. Of cases, 32%-75% develop small cystic airspaces within areas of ground-glass attenuation. Histopathologic correlation suggests that some of these cysts represent bronchioliectasis and dilated alveolar ducts, without honeycomb fibrosis. Because of its association with cigarette smoking, centrilobular emphysema is also common present. Spontaneous improvement may occur in untreated patients. The response to corticosteroid is unclear; however, most patients report a symptomatic improvement.

On bronchoscopy, there is a hypervascular mass within right main bronchus which is correlated with chest CT. On angiography, well-defined highly vascular mass supplied by right bronchial artery is revealed.
","Bronchial carcinoid tumors are classified as neuroendocrine neoplasms of the lung and they arise in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium. Bronchial carcinoids range from low-grade typical carcinoids to intermediate-grade atypical carcinoids to high-grade small cell carcinomas. Typical and atypical bronchial carcinoids have similar imaging features. Because most bronchial carcinoids (80-85% of cases) are located in central airways, radiologic findings are usually related to bronchial obstruction.
 On computed tomography (CT), Central bronchial carcinoids manifest as an endobronchial nodule or hilar or perihilar mass with a close anatomic relationship to the bronchus. The mass is usually a well-defined, round or ovoid lesion and may be slightly lobulated. Associated atelectasis, air trapping, obstructing pneumonitis, and mucoid impaction may also be seen. Peripheral bronchial carcinoids appear as solitary nodules. Calcification is visible on CT in 30% of cases. Carcinoids have a rich vascular stroma and often show marked, homogeneous enhancement on CT after intravenous administration of contrast material. 
On bronchoscopy, bronchial carcinoids are in a central location within reach of a bronchoscope. They appear as smooth, cherry red, polypoid endobronchial nodules.  Massive hemorrhage can be occurred due to biopsy. Prognosis of bronchial carcinoids is highly dependent on histologic findings. Recommended treatment of resectable atypical carcinoid tumor is completely surgical resection. And for unresectable case, chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is recommended.

","Lung torsion is a rare but potentially life-threatening event whereby a lobe or the entire lung twists about its pedicle, leading to venous congestion and/or hemorrhagic infarction. The most common clinical scenario is right middle lobe torsion after right upper lobectomy, which accounts for approximately three quarters of cases.
Other underlying circumstances that favor the development of pulmonary torsion include: (a) An airless lobe, consolidated or atelectatic, (b) A long, free, lobar pedicle, (c) Absence of a parenchymal bridge between contiguous lobes, (d) Pneumothorax or pleural effusion, (e)Transection of the inferior pulmonary ligament.
The degree of rotation in pulmonary torsion is generally 180°, although on occasion, 90°or 360° torsion has been recorded. Torsion of hilar structures and especially of the pulmonary veins leads to impaired circulation with reflux into the venous pathways, resulting in interstitial edema and alveolar exudation.
 CT findings include tapered obliteration of the proximal pulmonary artery and accompanying bronchus of the involved lobe. The torsed lobe demonstrates poorly enhancing consolidation with increased volume, ground-glass attenuation, interlobular septal thickening, and intralobular linear attenuation.

","Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous encapsulated yeast-like fungus that is found worldwide; particularly in soils that are contaminated with pigeon excreta and decayed wood. Inhalation of cryptococcal particles into the lungs is a route of pulmonary infection, and subsequent hematogenous dissemination may cause central nervous system infection. Cryptococcal infections are mostly common in immunocompromized patients such as those with AIDS, who underwent organ transplantation, or who have a hematologic malignancy. These infections are relatively rare in immunocompetent patients.
The most common CT findings in immunocompetent patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis were pulmonary nodules. The nodules were most often multiple, smaller than 10 mm in diameter, and well defined with smooth margins. Nodules most commonly involved less than 10% of the parenchyma and were distributed in the middle and upper lungs. Multiple nodules were most commonly bilateral. Masses, areas of consolidation, cases of lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions, and areas of cavitation occurred infrequently. Pulmonary cryptococcosis in AIDS patients tends to manifest itself as a disseminated thoracic disease with an interstitial lung pattern and lymph node enlargement as seen on imaging studies. The lesions may show high FDG uptake and may thus simulate a malignant condition at PET. Although clinical improvement can be achieved in all patients, radiological improvement is slow, even after antifungal therapy. Lastly, lung lesions may persist for a long time, showing a divergence from the clinical response.

It is characterized by multicentric, well-demarcated nodular proliferation of type II pneumocytes along alveolar septa. Since the hamartomatous nature of micronodular epithelial proliferations has been emphasized, the terms multiple adenomatoid tumors, acinar atypical adenomatoid proliferation of epithelium, and micronodular hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes have been proposed as being more descriptive names. Recently, these lesions have come to be commonly called MMPH, taking their pathogenesis and locations into account. MMPH can occur in patients with or without lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), predominantly in female patients. Clinically, patients with MMPH may present with dyspnea, cough, and mild to moderate hypoxemia. Unlike with pulmonary LAM, treatment is usually unnecessary because MMPH does not appear to be fatal and progressive.
At thin-section CT, multiple tiny nodules (3-10 mm) or numerous miliary nodules (1-3 mm) are diffusely scattered throughout the lung in a random distribution. Although differentiation of MMPH from miliary metastatic or granulomatous disease is difficult, MMPH should be considered in the differential diagnosis when multiple tiny pulmonary nodules are present in patients with TS.
This patient did not know about TS. After pathologic confirmation of lung lesion, TS was confirmed in gene test.

DIP can also occur in patients following exposure to certain inhaled toxins (occupational exposure) and drugs, and may occur in the context of certain viral illnesses and autoimmune diseases. In the context of DIP, occupational exposure should be systematically investigated.
Chest radiographs are insensitive for detection of DIP and are reported to be normal in 3%–22% of biopsy-proved cases.

","The diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome is established with the following three criteria: chronic liver disease, increased alveolar-arterial gradient on room air, and evidence of intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. Hypoxemia is seen in one-third of decompensated cirrhotic patients. The most important mechanism is pulmonary vascular dilatation and consequent ventilation-perfusion mismatch. It is more accurate to describe the intrapulmonary process associated with these vascular dilatations as a diffusion-perfusion abnormality rather than as an intrapulmonary shunt. Hypoxia is believed to result from an inability of oxygen to diffuse to the center of massively dilated peripheral vessels. 
Chest radiographs demonstrate basilar nodular or reticulonodular areas of increased opacity in 5%–13.8% of patients with chronic liver disease and 46%–100% of patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome. Lung volumes are preserved. Intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunting can be established with contrast (microbubble) echocardiography, technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin imaging, right-sided heart catheterization, or pulmonary arteriography. Transthoracic contrast echocardiography is performed by injecting contrast material (usually agitated saline) intravenously during echocardiography. Contrast (microbubble) generally appears in the left heart three to eight heart beats after its appearance in the right atrium when intrapulmonary shunt exists.
Computed tomography (CT) may demonstrate dilated vessels with an increased number of terminal branches extending to the pleura and can be useful in distinguishing hepatopulmonary syndrome from other causes of hypoxemia such as pulmonary fibrosis.

"," Aspergillus is a saprophytic conidial mold commonly inhaled from the environment, illness from which depending on the patients’ immune state and underlying lung pathology. There are three broad categories of pulmonary aspergillosis: allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) (Figure). Which category may develop depends largely on the underlying host characteristics and the interaction between the fungus and the host. Subacute invasive aspergillosis, formerly known as chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis, is a locally destructive lung disease which tends to manifest in mildly immunocompromised patients and progresses more rapidly, over 1-3 months. While subacute invasive aspergillosis is commonly grouped under chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), it is diagnosed and treated similarly to IPA. Fever, weight loss and night sweats, usually absent in patients with simple aspergilloma and aspergillus nodules, are common in subacute invasive aspergillosis. Inflammatory makers such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hrCRP) are also likely to be elevated. Sputum culture may also grow Aspergillus.
On CT image, It may be difficult to distinguish subacute invasive aspergillosis from otherwise CPA. Radiologic features of CPA are often a combination of both the Aspergillus infection and the underlying lung condition. They can range from new or pre-existing expanding cavities of variable wall thickness to pericavitary infiltrates, adjacent bronchiectasis, pleural thickening and effusions. New cavities result from central necrosis of consolidations. The cavity-wall is usually thicker in chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis and thinner in simple aspergilloma and subacute invasive aspergillosis.

","Acute phlegmonous esophagitis is uncommon disorder. A bacterial infection occurs in the submucosa and musculature of the esophagus. Phlegmonous infection usually involves the submucosa and not the mucosa. Phlegmonous infection may involve any gastrointestinal tract site, although the stomach is most frequently involved.
 The pathogenesis of acute phlegmonous esophagitis is unclear. Reported predisposing factors include immune suppression, alcoholism, peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis or some other gastric mucosal injury, achlorhydria, infection, connective tissue disease, and malignancy. 
 The reported CT findings of phegmonous esophagitis are esophageal wall thickening and intramural low-density areas. The area of intramural low attenuation surrounded by a peripherally enhancing rim represents intramural abscess. The air bubbles in the thickened esophageal wall seen on CT may be produced by gas-forming organisms (indicating emphysematous esophagogastritis), or the air bubbles may have entered the wall when the intramural abscess spontaneously drained into the lumen.

However, infection of varicella-zoster virus tends to cause serious complications such as varicella-zoster pneumonia in adults with lymphoma and immunocompromised or pregnant patients. The diagnosis of varicella infection is usually based on clinical findings such as skin rash, pulmonary symptoms, and a history of contact with a patient with chickenpox. With recovery from the initial disease, spherical nodules are observed to be scattered randomly throughout the lung parenchyma. Histologically, the nodules are composed of an outer lamellated fibrous capsule that encloses hyalinized collagen or necrotic tissue. Chest CT findings of varicella-zoster pneumonia consist of 1-10 mm well-defined or ill-defined nodules with a surrounding halo of ground glass opacity and coalescence of nodules diffusely throughout both lungs.

CT scan reveals multiple peribronchial tiny nodules, bronchial wall thickening and minimal bronchiectasis in both lungs. Fig 3. worsening of bronchial dilatation and bronchial wall thickening after 3 months. ","Bronchiolitis obliterans, or obliterative bronchiolitis, is the most common and most relevant late noninfectious pulmonary complication after HSCT. Its reported incidence varies from 2% to 48%, likely because of a lack of uniform classification. Most cases manifest within 6–12 months after transplant, although presentation as early as 3 months and as late as 10 years after transplant has been reported. Bronchiolitis obliterans is considered a manifestation of chronic GVHD in the lungs and therefore is a complication of allogeneic HSCT. Although bronchiolitis obliterans is not expected to occur after autologous HSCT, two fatal cases have been reported in the literature. 
Histologically, bronchiolitis obliterans is characterized by constrictive bronchiolitis with submucosal bronchiolar fibrosis and luminal narrowing affecting the small airways. The pathogenesis, in most cases, may be related to immunomediated mechanisms secondary to GVHD. 
Bronchiolitis obliterans is defined clinically by airflow obstruction. The term bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome describes a clinical syndrome characterized by an irreversible decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of at least 20% from the baseline. Patients with biopsy-proved bronchiolitis obliterans may not fulfill the clinical criteria for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome on the basis of pulmonary function test results, whereas patients with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome may not demonstrate the classic pathologic features. Nevertheless, these two terms are often used interchangeably in clinical practice. 
Patients frequently present with an insidious onset of dry cough and progressive dyspnea. Fever is rare unless there is a superimposed infection due to underlying bronchiectasis. Early in the disease course, HRCT may show normal findings or may demonstrate hyperinflation with subtle areas of decreased attenuation. Bronchiectasis is seen later in the course of the disease. The most characteristic HRCT manifestation of bronchiolitis obliterans is the mosaic perfusion pattern, a finding of areas of decreased attenuation and vascularity interspaced with areas of normal or increased attenuation. The mosaic perfusion pattern is highly suggestive of bronchiolitis obliterans in this population, with 74%–91% sensitivity and 67%–94% specificity. The areas of decreased attenuation are accentuated on expiratory-phase images because of airtrapping. In a recent study that assessed HRCT findings of bronchiolitis obliterans in patients after HSCT, the mosaic perfusion pattern was seen in all patients and showed a predominant peripheral distribution. Airtrapping was seen in 56% of cases. Therefore, it is strongly rec-ommended that HRCT of HSCT recipients should include both inspiratory- and expiratory-phase image acquisition.

","Pulmonary paragonimiasis is a food-borne parasitic disease caused by the lung fluke Paragonimus westermani, which is endemic in Southeast Asia and the Far East. The most common symptoms are intermittent hemoptysis or blood-tinged sputum and cough. After ingested by humans, Paragonimus excyst in the small intestine, and the larvae penetrate through intestinal wall to gain access to the peritoneal cavity. Several weeks later, the organism travels through the diaphragm on its way to the pleural space. Next they enter the lung, where they mature to adult flukes and produce cysts that contain eggs. Paragonimiasis typically results in single of multiple 1- to 4-cm cystic spaces containing reddish brown mucinous fluid. When erosion occurs into a draining airways, the contents of the cyst may be coughed up or may spread to other portions of the lung parenchyma and result is exudative or hemorrhagic pneumonia. 

The imaging manifestations of disease parallel to the life cycle of the parasites. The characteristic CT features of pulmonary paragonimiasis are round low attenuation cystic lesions filled with fluid or gas.

In coronal reconstructed image, the lesions shows splitting the left crus of the diaphragm and and abutting the stomach. 

On pathologic examination, respiratory epithelium was aligned with the wall of cystic mass, which was consistent with bronchogenic cyst.
","Bronchogenic cysts are congenital lesions thought to result from abnormal budding of the embryonic foregut. Mediastinal cysts are far more frequent and do not communicate with the bronchial tree, unlike intraparenchymal cysts in which such communications usually develop, leading to frequent recurrent infection. 
CT findings of bronchogenic cyst have been well described in the literature. They are usually sharply margined with soft tissue or water attenuation, with cystic characteristics. Some bronchogenic cysts may have soft tissue attenuation, and contrast enhanced CT may help in distinguishing malignancy by the lack of enhancement.
On MR scan, bronchogenic cysts shows variable signal instensity which are slightly hyperintense or isointense to skeletal muscle on T1WI and isointense or hyperintense to CSF. These thin-walled cysts are lined with respiratory epithelium and cyst fluid is composed primarily of water admixed with varying amounts of thick proteinaceous mucus. Calcium oxalate crystals have also been detected in the fluid.
They occur most commonly within the mediastinum but rarely in the diaphragm. Up to now, there have been few reported cases of intradiaphragmatic bronchogenic cyst reported.
In one report, 68 histopathologically proven cases of bronchogenic cyst were analyzed. There were 58 mediastinal and 10 extramediastinal cysts (85% vs. 15%). Most common location of bronchogenic cyst is carinal area (52%), followed by paratracheal area (19%), esophageal wall (14%) and retrocardiacl area (9%). Especially, the extramediastinal cysts were located in the lung parenchyma (7/10), the diaphragm (2/10) and the pleura in one case.

","The most common cause of benign solitary pulmonary nodules is mycobacterium tuberculosis, but recent advances in microbiologic diagnosis have led to increased confirmation of solitary pulmonary nodules due to NTM disease. Hong et al. have reported that the incidence of NTM pulmonary disease mimicking lung cancer clinically and radiologically was 3.6% (14 of 388). Typical imaging features of NTM disease are cellular bronchiolitis with or without bronchiectasis (i.e., nodular bronchiectatic form) or cavitary lesions with upper lung predominance (i.e., upper-lobe cavitary form). However, NTM pulmonary disease can also manifest as an SPN, solitary mass, or mass-like consolidation. These lesions usually present with radiologic features overlapping those of primary lung cancer. In contrast to primary lung cancer, NTM pulmonary disease typically shows poor contrast enhancement and frequent internal calcification on CT. FDG PET/CT does not provide additional information to help differentiation from lung cancer, because NTM disease can cause false-positive results including other chronic inflammatory diseases such as tuberculosis, fungal infection, and sarcoidosis. Considering the increasing prevalence of NTM disease worldwide, NTM disease should be included as one of the differential diagnoses of an SPN, mass, or mass-like consolidation in clinical practice.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1272-13.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1272-13.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1272-13.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1272-13.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1272-13.jpg']",88,"['correct:3/88', 'diff:6/88']"

","Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) is an entity characterized by pleural and subpleural parenchymal fibrosis. It is extremely rare and was first described in 2004 by the Interstitial Lung Disease Program of the National Jewish Medical and Research Center of Denver.
Marked apical pleural thickening associated with superior hilar retraction is present at chest
X ray analysis, and High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) shows pleural thickening, fibrosis, architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis and honeycomb lung. The clinical course of this affection is progressive and prognosis is poor. 

The etiology of PPFE is considered idiopathic in most cases, an association with a wide range of factors has been reported such as genetic predisposition

Chest radiographs in all cases showed marked apical pleural thickening, which was associated with superior hilar retraction. 

HRCT images show dense pleural and subpleural consolidation with a reticular pattern, predominantly in the upper lobes. The upper lobes were always more severely involved, with involvement of the lower lobes being absent or less marked (apicocaudal distribution). Associated features included upper lobe volume loss, architectural distortion and traction bronchiectasis. One of the patients showed significant worsening relative to previous examinations. Two of the patients showed reticular opacities with some
areas of honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis. The other patient had co-existent cystic bronchiectasis. The patients underwent a TTB in the higher density
zones. All the patients were complicated with mild to moderate iatrogenic pneumothoraxes. Placement of a chest tube was needed in three patients. The pneumothorax resolved completely before discharge with a hospital stay ranging between 1 day and 17 days. One of the patients was also complicated with subcutaneous emphysema.

The therapeutic approach is highly variable in the published clinical cases with no clearly definitive therapeutic options other than lung transplantation. Disease progression occurs in 60 % of patients with death from disease in 40 %.

","Occupational lung diseases are a broad group of diagnosis caused by the inhalation of dusts, chemicals, or proteins. “Pneumoconiosis” is the term used for the diseases associated with inhaling inorganic particles and mineral dust. The severity of the disease is related to the material inhaled and the intensity and duration of the exposure. 
Most pneumoconiosis is due to a single stimulus, but two or more different minerals concomitantly responsible for pulmonary disease constitute mixed dust pneumoconiosis (MDP). Anthraco-silicosis and silico-siderosis are main examples of mixed dust exposures which can occur from an exposure to a dust mixture in which the patient has inhaled two different particle types concurrently. There may also be the combination of silicosis and siderosis, the combination of aluminosis and silicosis, the combination of argyria and siderosis, and combinations of other mineral dusts include talc with asbestos, talc with silica, and talc with kaolin. In rare cases, an individual patient may have both asbestos and silicosis or mixed dust pneumoconiosis.
Radiologic findings may help to differentiate mixed dust pneumoconiosis and to distinguish classic silicosis. The classic chest X-ray pattern of MDP is a bilateral mixture of irregular or reticular opacities with small rounded nodules, as defined by the ILO classification. However, the findings depend on the component proportions of the mixed dust and the cumulative exposure history. Chest CT may show a reticular, reticulonodular or nodular pattern with emphysema and honeycombing. In exceptional cases, however, in which MDP is present together with another well-defined pneumoconiosis such as asbestosis, the diagnosis mixed dust pneumoconiosis or MDP with, for example, asbestosis might be made.

The pulmonary nodule gradually increases to segmental air-space consolidation, which suggests the bronchogenic spread of the disease. Central low-attenuation areas may be multiple and variable in size and show rim-like peripheral enhancement on enhanced CT. Histologically, central low-attenuation areas seen on CT represent microabscesses, which contain actinomycotic or sulfur granules. The peripheral enhancing portion is composed of an outer rim of granulation tissue and fibrosis. Differential diagnoses of the parenchymal type include tuberculosis, bacterial or fungal necrotizing pneumonia, and lung cancer.

The principal treatment of actinomycosis is long-term use of high-dose intravenous penicillin. The course of the disease depends largely on adequate and early antibiotic therapy.

Fig 5. CT scan viewed at mediastinal window setting shows focal esophageal wall defects above the esophagogastric junction indicating full-thickness esophageal perforation and bilateral pleural effusion.
","Spontaneous esophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome) is a very uncommon, life-threatening surgical emergency that should be suspected in all patients presenting with lower thoracic-epigastric pain and a combination of gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms. Variable clinical manifestations and subtle or unspecific radiographic findings often result in critical diagnostic delays. Multidetector computed tomography complemented with CT-esophagography represents the ideal “one-stop shop” investigation technique to allow a rapid, comprehensive diagnosis of Boerhaave syndrome, including identification of suggestive periesophageal abnormalities, direct visualization of esophageal perforation and quantification of mediastinitis.
Whatever its location and etiology, rupture of the esophagus is a life-threatening condition which remains a difficult diagnostic and management problem. If esophageal perforation is detected within the first 24 h of the onset of symptoms, surgical treatment is usually possible. After 24 h the survival rate is 20% or lower. Pathophysiologically, Boerhaave’s syndrome is due to a sudden rise in intraluminal esophageal pressure during vomiting, in the presence of a closed glottis. There is failure of the cricopharyngeous muscle to relax due to neuromuscular incoordination. Age is an important prerequisite factor for this neuromuscular incoordination. Anatomically the tear is located at the left posterolateral wall in the lower third of the esophagus (in the chest). Free fluid and air leak into the posterior mediastinum and then into the left pleural cavity. Fluoroscopic esophagography with ingestion of water-soluble contrast medium was used to confirm suspected esophageal perforation through the direct demonstration of extraluminal contrast extravasation.

","Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of clonal plasma cell proliferation arising in the bone marrow. A minority of patients with multiple myeloma have imaging findings of extraosseous involvement. Recent studies suggest that clinically or radiologically detectable extraosseous manifestations occur in approximately 10–16% of patients with multiple myeloma. Extraosseous myeloma may affect any organ and can mimic other malignancies. Patients with extraosseous myeloma have significantly shorter overall survival and shorter progression-free survival.
The skeletal involvement of multiple myeloma shows lytic bone lesions, diffuse osteopenia and osteoporotic fractures. The predominant areas of skeletal bone involvement include the axial skeleton - vertebral bodies (49%), skull (35%), pelvis (34%), and ribs (33%) - as well as the proximal metaphysis of long bones, especially the femur and humerus.
Extraosseous myeloma can affect any organ, and its imaging findings are nonspecific. Common imaging features include soft-tissue masses with homogeneous density on CT, a lack of necrosis and calcification, low T2 signal on MRI because of high cellularity, and FDG uptake on FDG PET.
Extraosseous myeloma in the thorax occurs most commonly in the form of pulmonary parenchymal nodules, masses, or interstitial infiltration. The lung nodules appear as multiple scattered forms in both lungs. Pleural involvement can also be seen. CT image shows pleural thickening or irregular nodular pleural-based soft tissues with pleural effusion.

There were seen large contour bulging mass opacities in left lower hemithorax on lateral view. 
Findings of pre- and postcontrast-enhanced chest CT (Figure 2-5) revealed heterogeneously enhancing (20-80 Hounsfiled unit) well-defined 2 separate large masses, which were located in each anterior and middle mediastinum of the left lower hemithorax. The large one of the masses in left anterior mediastinum was measured about 15 x 9 x 8cm, which showed broad contact with the left chest wall anteriorly, mass effect with compression resulting in contour deformity of the adjacent left cardiac chambers posteromedially on axial scan (Figure 3) and inversion of the left diaphragm inferiorly on coronal scan (Figure 4-5). The other separate smaller mass in the middle mediastinum of the left lower hemithorax was measured about 6 x 7 x 7cm, which was located between posterior wall of the left ventricle and left lateral wall of the descending thoracic aorta on axial and coronal scans (Figure 2-3). Intervening mediastinal fat plane between those masses and adjacent mediastinal structures seemed to be preserved with compression and contour deformity of the left cardiac chambers and no definite evidence of direct tumor invasion. 

Excision of the mediastinal masses was performed and the final diagnosis was confirmed.  
On gross histopathologic examination, the tumors were seen as multilobulated, friable, soft masses and measuring 19 x 13 x 6cm in the larger one (Figure 8). Microscopically, the tumors revealed lobular growth pattern with hemorrhage and extensive necrosis and were composed of uniform round blue cells with inapparent, small nucleoli, and scanty cytoplasm (Figure 9). 

","Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (ES/PNET) represent a family of high-grade small round cell tumors, which have neuroectodermal origin and show varying degrees of neuronal differentiation. The Ewing sarcoma family of tumors includes classic Ewing sarcoma of bone, extra-skeletal Ewing sarcoma, Askin tumors of the chest wall, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors of bone or soft tissues.
These highly malignant tumors are reported commonly in children and young adults, which show_80%of patients being in their first 2 decades of life. Extraskeletal ES/PNETs are quite rare than skeletal ES/PNETs and common location of extraskeletal ES/PNETs is thoracopulmonary area. Among the thoracopulmonary ES/PNETs, primary mediastinal ES/PNETs are very rare. 
On chest CT scan, ES/PNET usually manifests as a large unilateral heterogeneously enhancing mass, often with low attenuating necrosis or cystic areas and high attenuating hemorrhage. The tumor tends to displace rather than encase adjacent structures such as vessels, the trachea/bronchi, or the mediastinum, which finding also can be well recognized in our case. Calcification of the mass is relatively rare and can be seen in 10 % of the tumors. Lymph node metastasis is also rarely seen. Interestingly, distant metastasis is rare at the time of diagnosis in the thoracopulmonary ES/PNET, but after treatment, including excision, chemotherapy, and local radiation therapy, the tumor shows tendency of frequent local recurrence and distant metastasis as seen in our case. In case of thoracopulmonary ES/PNET, the tumor is frequently associated with adjacent rib or sternum destruction and pleural effusion.
In our case, the mediastinal tumors revealed relatively typical CT features, which include heterogeneously enhancing large masses with areas of low attenuation corresponding tumor necrosis on gross specimen. No calcification was identified and there was no lymph node metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis. Our case presented as separate 2 synchronous masses in each anterior and middle mediastinum at initial diagnosis. 
The ES/PNET group of tumors has been known to have poor prognosis. Askin et al reported median survival of only 8 months after the diagnosis of the tumor. However, recent studies show significant improvement in 5-year overall survival of exceeding 60% to 65% for localized ES/PNET with a combination of surgical excision, intense chemotherapy, and high-dose radiotherapy. Most important prognostic factors are known as tumor size, presence of distant metastasis at presentation, and surgical resection margin.

","This patient had a previous history of dyspnea and was admitted with severe dyspnea following exposure to nitric acid in his work environment. 

Inhalation injuries occur as a result of toxic absorption and may cause asphyxiation, local irritation, or allergic reactions. Irritant gases when inhaled in high concentrations injure the respiratory tract by causing acute inflammation. The main site of injury depends on the solubility of the gases; more soluble gases like ammonia exert maximal effect on the proximal respiratory tract, while less soluble gases like nitric acid fumes exert greater effect on the distal airway. 

Nitric acid is a commonly used strong acid agent used in metal refining, cleaning, electroplating and other industrial applications. It generates oxides of nitrogen, including nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which cause chemical pneumonitis when inhaled.

The clinical presentation of nitric acid inhalation injury depends on the duration and intensity of exposure. Within the first several hours, mild cases may stay asymptomatic. After a latency of 3-24 hours, the first typical symptoms of pulmonary edema may appear resulting in acute respiratory failure. However, in severe exposure cases diffuse alveolar damage can develop.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1284-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1284-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1284-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1284-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1284-11.jpg']",84,"['correct:34/84', 'diff:26/84', 'semi:3/84']"

Fig 3-4. Two weeks later, previsouly noted ill-defined centrilobular nodules and GGO are increased in extent in both lungs.

","Lung-transplanted patients are at particular risk of allograft infections and radiologists should be aware of the epidemiology of pneumonias according to their time of onset.
The first postoperative month is mostly associated with bacterial and fungal pathogens. Bacterial infections are the most common. CT signs of bacterial infections include extensive consolidations with air bronchogram, disseminated patchy consolidations, branching centrilobular nodules, and cavitations or abscesses. CT signs of angioinvasive aspergillosis are isolated or multiple vessel centered nodular consolidations with peripheral ground-glass halo sign consistent with hemorrhagic infarcts.
From the second to sixth months, long-term immunosuppression of T-cells is responsible for viral pneumonias. CT signs mainly consist of ground-glass opacities or tree-in-bud nodules. Fungal and parasitic opportunistic infections can also occur, either from reactivation of latent germs, in particular from cytomegalovirus (CMV), or by community-acquired or nosocomial transmission. CT signs for such diseases also include ground-glass opacities, tree-in-bud nodules, or an interstitial pattern with peribronchovascular and septal thickening. 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common cause of opportunistic infection. The rate of CMV infection in lung transplant recipients has been reported to be at least 50%. Seronegative recipients who receive seropositive donor lungs are at the highest risk for primary infection after transplantation. CMV infection typically occurs between 1 and 6 months and is rarely seen earlier than 2 weeks after lung transplantation. Pneumonia is the most common manifestation of CMV infection. Frequently seen radiographic patterns include focal or diffuse parenchymal haziness, lobar consolidation, and small pleural effusions. The most common CT manifestations include ground-glass opacities, tree-in-bud opacities, airspace consolidation, nodules, interlobular septal thickening, pleural effusions, thickened and enhancing pleura, and bronchiectasis.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1285-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1285-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1285-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1285-11.jpg']",80,"['correct:45/80', 'diff:19/80', 'semi:2/80']"

Initial diagnosis of rheumatoid nodule was confirmed following right lower lobe wedge resection. ","Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic inflammatory disorder that commonly affects the joints, causing the progressive, symmetric, and erosive destruction of cartilage and bone in conjunction with autoantibody production. Rheumatoid arthritis affects ∼1% of the population in developed countries. There are also a number of extra-articular manifestations, including subcutaneous nodule formation, vasculitis, inflammatory eye disease and lung disease. Among these manifestations, lung disease is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality. In some cases, respiratory symptoms may precede articular symptoms. Respiratory symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis can be caused by a variety of conditions that affect the parenchyma, pleura, airways or vasculature. The majority of respiratory manifestations occur within the first 5 years of disease. Pulmonary involvement may reflect chronic immune activation, increased susceptibility to infection (often related to immunomodulatory medications) or direct toxicity from disease modifying or biological therapy. Prognosis varies depending on the type and severity of involvement.
While RA-ILD is the most common form of pulmonary involvement, rheumatoid nodules can also occur, particularly in patients with longstanding disease and subcutaneous nodules. On HRCT, they are typically located along the interlobular septa or in subpleural regions. Nodules may be single or multiple, ranging in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres. Nodules are typically asymptomatic unless they cavitate or rupture, in which case infection, pleural effusion or bronchopleural fistula may occur. Uncomplicated nodules may spontaneously regress or improve with standard rheumatoid arthritis therapy. However, rheumatoid nodules have, at times, been noted to paradoxically enlarge with rheumatoid arthritis treatment, with enlargement being observed specifically in methotrexate treatment cases. In patients who are past or current smokers, it is important to differentiate nodules from malignancy. Positron emission tomography scans may be used in the evaluation of nodules ≥8 mm in diameter; in general, rheumatoid nodules show little or no uptake on positron emission tomography scans, although increased uptake may be seen if active inflammation is present.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1286-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1286-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1286-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1286-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1286-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1286-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1286-11.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1286-11.jpg']",79,"['correct:55/79', 'diff:11/79', 'semi:1/79']"

","  Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LG) is a rare, aggressive extranodal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disease with reactive T-cells. While histopathologic features in patients with grade I LG are compatible with benign lymphocytic angiitis and granulomatosis, grade II LG follows an aggressive course, and grade III LG lesions should be considered diffuse large B-cell malignant lymphomas. LG usually manifests in the 5th or 6th decade of life, is more common among immunocompromised patients, and affects male subjects twice as often as it affects female subjects. The lungs are the most commonly involved site in patients with LG, with less frequent involvement of the skin, kidney, liver, and central nervous system. Although LG is a lymphoproliferative disorder, it is found less commonly in lymph nodes, the spleen, and bone marrow. Symptoms range from nonspecific systemic manifestations—such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue—to organ-specific symptoms—such as dyspnea, cough, and chest pain—in patients with lung involvement. The prognosis is generally poor, with a 5-year mortality rate of 60%–90%. However, early diagnosis and aggressive intervention may be life-saving in patients with this rare but potentially treatable disease. A standard treatment has yet to be established but in most of the published series, first-line treatment consists of corticosteroid therapy, either alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide.

  Chung et al reported the imaging findings of LG as nodules and masses with lymphatic distribution as would be expected for a lymphoproliferative disease. Central low attenuation, ground-glass halo and peripheral enhancement of the nodules/masses can be also presented, likely related to the angioinvasive nature of this disease. LG can also be seen as diffuse ill-defined ground-glass opacities and nodules in a peribronchovascular distribution, with middle and lower zone predominance. The nodules may be confluent, and they may fluctuate in size over time. Of note, synchronous regression and progression of pulmonary nodules at chest CT may be observed. This has been attributed to focal attenuation of the local T-cell response and should be taken into account in the evaluation of treatment response. Our patient was proved as a LG, grade 3 on surgical lung biopsy and treated with chemotherapy.

","IgG4-related disease(IgG4-RD) is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by elevated serum IgG4 levels and infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells on histopathologic examination. Clinical manifestations of this disease have been demonstrated in nearly every organ system. Hepato-pancreato-biliary infiltration, retroperitoneal fibrosis and/or aortitis, lymphadenopathy, and Mikulicz disease (IgG4related dacryoadenitis and sialadenitis) are common systemic involvements of this disease, with IgG4-related aortitis/periaortitis and periarteritis being its vascular manifestations. 

Computed tomography (CT) findings of IgG4-RD include arterial wall thickening and homogeneous wall enhancement. The dissection of the great vessels and myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery involvement are fatal manifestations of IgG4-RD. Fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET)-CT shows increased FDG uptake in multiple involved organs. The differential diagnosis includes inflammatory aortic aneurysm, lymphoma, large-vessel vasculitis such as Takayasu arteritis. Systemic involvement is also important for diagnosis of this disease. Recommended treatment of IgG4-RD is corticosteroid with conservative treatment.

","Pulmonary sequestration is a rare congenital pulmonary disorder with an incidence rate of approximately 0.1%. According to some journals, it occurs slightly more in males. It is defined as an area of dysplastic and non-functioning pulmonary tissue with an anomalous systemic blood supply. It has been classically described in two forms: intralobar sequestrations located within the visceral pleura and surrounded by normal lung, and extralobar sequestrations which have a separate pleural covering. There is no communication with the tracheobronchial tree. In the vast majority of cases, the abnormal lung tissue is supplied by an artery which is usually a branch of the aorta.

CT shows the arterial supply originating from the descending aorta. Intralobar bronchopulmonary sequestration affects the lower lobes in 95% of cases and the middle or upper lobes in 2% of cases. Intralobar bronchopulmonary sequestration most commonly presents as either a well-defined homogeneous opacity in the lung base or a solitary lung nodule. Air–fluid levels, caused by bronchial communication, can be seen in 26% of cases. Other findings include recurrent pneumonia or focal bronchiectasis.CT shows the arterial supply by the descending aorta.

","Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a technique for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases with catheter-directed intraarterial administration of yttrium-90 (90Y) resin or glass microspheres. Patients who are scheduled for this treatment all undergo initial evaluation to assess for tumor-induced arteriovenous shunting to the lung parenchyma (ie, hepatopulmonary shunting) with the use of intraarterial technetium-99m (99mTc) macroaggregated albumin (MAA) administration and quantitative scintigraphy. MAA can pass through tumor-associated arteriovenous shunts and become deposited in the pulmonary vasculature. If the hepatopulmonary shunt fraction is sufficiently large for 90Y microspheres, a dose-dependent radiation-induced pneumonitis may ensue. The clinical manifestation of radiation pneumonitis after TARE is nonspecific respiratory symptoms such as nonproductive, dyspnea and fever. And this symptoms and radiologic findings are usually developed 1~2months after treatment. As a result of hepatic arteriovenous shunting, the microspheres entered the pulmonary circulation causing radiation pneumonitis with a unique appearance on radiographs and CT scans in this patient. CT scans showed air-space consolidation radiation from the hila and becoming confluent just short of the lung periphery. The subpleural and perihilar areas are relatively spared. And discrete demarcation between the consolidation and the normal peripheral pulmonary parenchymal is apparent. These may resolve or progress toward localized fibrosis, traction bronchiectasis and focal honeycombing. Late complications include pneumothorax and superinfections.

","Chordoma is a rare, slow-growing malignant bone tumor exhibiting notochordal differentiation. It accounts for 1–4% of all primary malignant bone tumors. It affects men twice as frequently as women and is most commonly diagnosed in adults older than 30 (peak around 50 years). Chordoma almost exclusively involves the axial skeleton, and nearly 90% of cases occur in the sacrococcygeal region and in the base of the skull. The remaining cases predominantly develop in the cervical and lumbar spine; chordomas in the thoracic spine are even more uncommon, accounting for 3% of all chordomas.
Radiologically, chodroma may appear as a well-circumscribed soft tissue density mass in the paravertebral region, with or without invasion or involvement of adjacent bony structures. Scalloping of the anterior border of the adjacent vertebral body may be seen, suggesting extrinsic compression by an extrinsic mass, as was the case in our patient.

Previously known as chronic necrotizing aspergillosis or semi-invasive aspergillosis, it is a subacute to chronic, localized, and indolent form of invasive aspergillosis.  

Development of chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA) occurs over several months, with the condition commonly relapsing, even after surgery. Over time, if untreated, these cavities enlarge and coalesce, and fungal balls may appear or disappear. The development from CCPA to SIPA is caused by cavity expansion and is found among patients with impaired immunity. SIPA is the progressive enlargement of a single (preexisting) cavity, usually with a thin wall, either progressing slowly over months or rapidly in weeks. The rapidity of installation seems closer to that of invasive forms of aspergillosis in the non-immunocompromised context.

Oral itraconazole is the initial drug of choice and considerably superior to standard supportive therapy, with a relatively safe proﬁle even if administered over several months. Voriconazole is a second-line oral therapy that can be used when adverse eﬀects or failure of therapy occur with itraconazole. Although duration of therapy is variable, a minimum of 6 months is generally recommended. A recently published paper suggested extended antifungal treatment therapy for 12 months for demonstrable clinical improvement. Asymptomatic patients can also be safely observed without antifungal therapy and reassessed every 3–6 months.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1296-12.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1296-12.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1296-12.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1296-12.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1296-12.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1296-12.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1296-12.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1296-12.jpg']",61,"['correct:11/61', 'diff:12/61', 'semi:12/61']"

Right pericardial defect is extremely uncommon. Patients are usually asymptomatic, however herniation and strangulation of the heart or lungs through the pericardial defect can happen. Pericardial defects allows interposition of lung tissue between the aorta and the main segment of the ipsilateral pulmonary artery, and, occasionally bulging of the ipsilateral atrial appendage through the defect. Thirty percent of patients have associated defects: atrial septal defect, bicuspid aortic valve, patent ductus arteriosus, and tetralogy of Fallot are the most common associated cardiac defects and which are detectable on CT or MR images.

There was no evidence of infection on viral panel test, specimen Ag tests, blood culture and bronchoalveolar lavage. Furthermore, there was no abnormality on test of rheumatologic disease. After exclusion of other plausible diagnoses, he diagnosed with EVALI.
EVALI (E-cigarette or Vaping product use-Associated Lung Injury) is an acute or subacute pulmonary injury induced by inhaling an aerosol that is created by heating vape products. The E-cigarettes users inhale variable substances, including nicotine, flavors, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cannabidiol (CBD), in aerosol form. These aerosols induced edema of airways with epithelial sloughing, alveolar inflammation, and edema with hypoxemia. The EVALI is more common in person who used vaping products containing THC and/or vitamin E acetate. However, other additives including nicotine, CBD, coconut oil and limonene might be involved in lung injury.
The clinical manifestation of the EVALI is nonspecific, including respiratory (cough, shortness of breath, chest pain), gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, diarrhea), and constitutional symptoms (fever, fatigue). The EVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion; the patient must elicit a history of recent E-cigarette use, other possible etiologies must be eliminated (e.g., infection, other drug or exposure, connective tissue disease, and so on), and chest imaging findings must be abnormal. 
The majority of patients show diffuse hazy or consolidative opacities on chest radiographs, The most common CT finding is basilar-predominant consolidation with ground-glass opacity and lobular or subpleural sparing. Furthermore, chest CT findings reveal heterogeneity of pathologic patterns of lung injury including organizing pneumonia (OP), diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), exogenous lipoid pneumonia, giant cell interstitial pneumonia (GIP) and respiratory bronchiolitis.
Systemic corticosteroid is used for the treatment of EVALI but the efficacy has not been studied.

","MALT lymphoma (MALToma) is a monoclonal lymphoid proliferation arising from a B-cell progenitor within the BALT, and is classified as low-grade marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Histologically, MALT lymphoma is a lesion comprised of sheets of monoclonal lymphocytes with occasional interspersed plasma cells.
The radiologic features of BALT lymphomas do not differ from those of other pulmonary lymphomas. Most commonly, lesions consist of masses, masslike areas of consolidation, or pulmonary nodules. On PET/CT, BALT lymphomas may or may not show increased uptake of FDG. Air bronchograms and enhancing vessels through the masses can be observed. Pleural effusion and thickening, cavitation, and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are not commonly seen.

","Schwannoma is also known as neurilemmoma, neurinoma, or perineural fibroblastoma. It is a benign tumor of Schwann cell origin and is the most common tumor of peripheral nerves. It is arising from the neural sheath Schwann cells of the peripheral, cranial, or autonomic nerves.
Neurogenic tumors comprise 9% of mediastinal masses in adults and 29% in children. Schwannoma is the most common (about 50%) mediastinal neurogenic tumor. A high proportion of posterior mediastinal masses are neurogenic. Approximately 80% of the lesions found in the posterior compartment were reported to be neurogenic tumors in the previous study [1]. Neurogenic tumors less commonly occur in the anterior and middle compartments, and localization to these compartments does not discriminate neurogenic tumors from other mediastinal tumors. In these compartments, including neurogenic tumors in the differential diagnosis must depend on other imaging characteristics.
Historically, in adults, the most common type of mediastinal tumor or cyst found is the neurogenic tumor (21%-usually in posterior mediastinum), followed by thymic tumors (19%-anterior mediaastinum), lymphomas (13%), and germ cell tumors (10%).
Only approximately one-third of the mediastinal tumors produce symptoms in adults.
On plain radiographs, schwannoma is usually sharply marginated, spherical and lobulated paraspinal mass.
On CT images, well circumscribed masses with low to intermediate attenuation which displace adjacent structures without direct invasion. Cystic and fatty degeneration are common. Small tumors typically demonstrate homogeneous enhancement. Large tumors may show heterogeneous enhancement. The larger a schwannoma, the more likely it is to show heterogeneity because of cystic degeneration or hemorrhage. Hemorrhage occurs in 5% of cases and calcification is rare.
On MR images, schwannoma shows isointense or hypointense signal intensity on T1-weighted images and intense enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. However, the enhancement may be heterogeneous because of cystic degeneration or hemorrhage. It shows heterogeneously hyperintense signal on T2-weight images. Cystic degenerative areas may be present, especially in larger tumors. Larger tumors often have areas of hemosiderin which can be detected on the T2* images. 
Schwannomas are slow-growing lesions. Surgery is the treatment of choice. As schwannomas do not infiltrate the parent nerve, they can usually be separated from it. Recurrence is unusual, even after complete resection. They almost never undergo malignant change.

Figure 2-6. CT scans reveals diffuse widespread ground glass opacities with superimposed smooth interlobular septal thickening giving a typical appearance called ""crazy paving pattern”. There is subpleural and equivocal costophrenic recess sparing.
","Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare respiratory syndrome characterized by the accumulation of surfactant lipoproteins within the alveoli, caused by an impairment of surfactant clearance or abnormal surfactant production, leading to variable impairment of the respiratory function. Diagnosis of PAP is initiated by computed tomography (CT) scan and confirmed by staining of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). PAP is classified, according to various pathogenetic mechanisms, as primary, secondary or congenital; primary autoimmune form represents 90% of all PAP cases.
Chest radiography commonly demonstrates diffuse bilateral symmetrical infiltrates in a perihilar distribution, which can progress to confluent infiltrates involving all the five lobes. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest is mandatory to identify the peculiar radiological pattern that is characterized by interlobular septal thickening associated with patchy ground glass, known as “crazy paving”, referring to the polygonal appearance of the secondary pulmonary lobules within interspersed ground-glass attenuation. Areas of consolidation with air bronchograms can be present in addition to the ground-glass opacification. Fibrosis on HRCT at baseline or at follow-up predicts a poor prognosis. Pleural effusion, enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes and evidence of air trapping are not characteristic, and should lead to alternate or concomitant diagnosis. Pulmonary nodules are also atypical and should be assessed for malignancy or infection. BALF staining is required for the diagnosis of PAP. When performed in a diseased lung area, BALF typically has a milky appearance but might appear abnormal or normal if performed in a healthy zone with a weak amount of lipoproteinaceous material. 

Whole-lung lavage is the current gold standard of care of PAP; however, the therapeutic approach is strictly related to the pathogenic form and disease severity, including granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor augmentation strategies in autoimmune PAP and other promising new treatments.

","Malignant pleural mesothelioma is uncommon aggressive malignant tumor of the mesothelium. It is the most common primary malignant neoplasm of the pleura.

The industries with the highest risk of mesothelioma are construction and ship repair, asbestos industry, and manufacture of metal construction materials. Other risk factors include environmental factors, genetic factors and radiation. The mean age at diagnosis is 63 years. Symptoms may include dyspnea, chest pain, cough, and weight loss. CT is the primary imaging modality used to evaluate malignant mesothelioma. CT findings of malignant mesothelioma include nodular pleural thickening, interlobar fissure thickening, pleural effusion, ipsilateral mediastinal shift, pleural calcification, and invasion into the chest wall.

","Gastrointestinal schwannomas are uncommon benign neoplasms that are uniquely different from conventional soft t issue and central nervous system schwannomas. Histologically, gastrointestinal schwannomas are S-100 protein–positive spindle cell tumors with a microtrabecular pattern, peripheral lymphoid cuffing, and occasional germinal centers. They typically do not show a nuclear palisading pattern and lack of neurofibromatosis-2 genetic alterations that is usually present in conventional schwannomas.
Gastrointestinal schwannomas are classified as mesenchymal or neuroectodermal neoplasms, which are hypothesized to arise from the myenteric plexus within the gastrointestinal tract wall.
 Gastrointestinal schwannomas occur most commonly in the stomach (60–70%), followed by the colon and rectum; and esoph¬ageal schwannomas are rarely found. 
Esophageal schwannomas occur primarily in the middle-aged women and are usually located in the upper esophagus. Esophageal schwannomas are usually asymptomatic; some¬times, they can initially cause dysphagia, and later in the course of disease, dyspnea occurs due to tracheal compression.
The CT findings of gastrointestinal schwannomas is homogeneously attenuating well-defined mu¬ral mass. A differential diagnosis for a mass arising in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract is a GIST because it is the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract. But the most difference in the CT features of GISTs compared with schwannomas is the presence of hemorrhage, necrosis, and cystic change, which give GISTs a much more heterogeneous appearance on CT. Esophageal schwannomas, which presented with the characteristic of homogeneously attenuating well-defined mural mass, is indistinguishable from leiomyoma on the basis of imaging alone. 
The FDG uptake of schwannomas can be variable. Schwannomas generally have a high tumor-to-background ratio on FDG PET. Beaulieu et al. reported 50% (5/10) of the lesions showed an SUVav greater than 3.0. An SUVmax of 6.0 cannot exclude schwannoma from the differential diagnosis. Distinguishing schwannomas from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors before biopsy or surgery is not possible. Schwannoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve sheath tumors with low, intermediate, or high SUVs.
Most of gastrointestinal schwannomas are biologically benign and that most patients have an excellent prognosis after surgical resection.

Amyloidosis can be localized or systemic (and often lethal if not effectively treated). Involvement of the lung is relatively common, but rarely symptomatic. Amyloidosis can appear in the lung in three different forms: nodular pulmonary amyloidosis, diffuse alveolar-septal amyloidosis and tracheobronchial amyloidosis. Lung diseases characterized by chronic inflammation (e.g. bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis) can give rise to systemic AA (apolipoprotein serum amyloid A) amyloidosis. Moreover, respiratory manifestations are common in systemic amyloidosis. Finally, amyloid deposits can directly target the lung and respiratory tract. Nodular amyloidosis, as in this patient, is almost always localized to the lungs. The nodules usually are concentrated in the lower lobes and are typically subpleural or peripheral. They vary in shape and size (range, 0.5–15.0 cm). Calcification or ossification is seen in up to 50% of cases and can help indicate the diagnosis.

Situs solitus, situs inversus, and situs ambiguous (so-called heterotaxy) have been used to describe the normal, mirror image of normal, and non-mirror-image deviation from the normal left-right visceroatrial configuration, respectively. Visceroatrial situs should include a description of the position of the upper lobe bronchi to their ipsilateral pulmonary arteries-the most reliable imaging feature of bronchial situs, and thus atrial morphology. The morphologic right lung is defined when the upper lobe bronchus is positioned above the ipsilateral pulmonary artery in the hilum (eparterial). The morphologic left lung is supplied by a hyparterial bronchus, which courses below the ipsilateral pulmonary artery. 
Heterotaxy syndromes are frequently associated with bronchopulmonary isomerism-an identical pattern of branching and lobar configuration in each lung. Bilateral eparterial and hyparterial bronchi characterize right and left bronchial isomerism (bilateral right- and left-sidedness), respectively. Right isomerism (bilateral right-sidedness) typically manifests with bilateral trilobed lungs and eparterial bronchi, bilateral right atria, right aortic arch, and asplenia (or some functional loss).

The most common symptom is dyspnea, but it doesn’t suggest cardiac metastasis obviously because the lung metastasis may be seen in many of the patients (2). When evaluating the cardiac metastasis, pericardium should be closely observed as pericardial involvement has been reported in up to 40% of the patients with cardiac metastasis and 15% of cytological examination of pericardial effusion are malignant (3). In previous reports, an intracardiac or pericardial mass was the most specific indicator of cardiac metastasis. The cardiac metastasis is common in the right chamber of the heart, but occurs on the left side when accompanied by lung metastasis. 
The prognosis of most cardiac metastases is extremely poor. Previous literatures describe perioperative mortality rate to be 40% and average survival time to be 5 months (2, 3). Radiation therapy is recommended and surgical resection is limited.

","Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common subtype, representing 75%–80% of all RCCs according to the Heidelberg classification and has the highest risk of developing metastatic disease. By invading the retroperitoneal lymphatics and traversing the thoracic duct, RCC can sometimes reach distant locations, such as the thoracic (mediastinal and hilar) or supraclavicular nodes, and even the lung (through thoracic duct drainage into the subclavian vein). Metastatic lesions usually show contrast enhancement similar to that of the primary tumor. Pulmonary metastases account for 45% of all metastases from RCC, representing the most common anatomic site of disseminated RCC. Lymph node metastasis is the third most common group of metastatic RCC lesions, accounting for 22% of cases. Recurrence of RCC after initial curative treatment typically occurs within 5 years in most patients. However, a late recurrence more than 5 years after the initial treatment can also occur, which is one of the specific biological behaviors of RCC.

","•	An esophageal ulcer is a distinct break in the margin of the esophageal mucosa. This mucosal damage to the esophagus is often caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease or from severe sustained esophagitis from other causes. Corrosive or caustic agents and ingested foreign bodies can cause direct esophageal mucosal damage. Infections causing inflammation of the esophagus include Candida species, Herpes simplex, and cytomegalovirus. Prognosis is good in patients who are compliant with their therapy and maintain an appropriate diet. Untreated esophageal ulcerations can lead to bleeding. In this case, intramural esophageal dissection was noted, which is an uncommon disorder characterized by a lengthy laceration deeper to the mucosal layer of the esophageal wall, without complete perforation. 
•	Intramural dissection can be considered an intermediate form of injury between a Mallory-Weiss tear and transmural perforation.

Common CT findings of DIP are characterized as bilateral areas of ground-glass opacity with peripheral, basal predominance, which may reflect the filling of alveolar airspaces by macrophages. Irregular and linear opacities and reticular patterns are frequent usually in the base of the lung (59%), but honeycombing is uncommon. Coexistent emphysema may be present.

CT shows a mass-like lesion with little enhancement in the left lower paraspinal area. USG demonstrated a well-defined wedge-shaped mass-like lesion without vascularity in the left paraspinal area. We suspected torsion of pulmonary sequestration based on the typical location of the lesion, clinical symptom, and imaging findings. VATS was performed and the lesion was finally diagnosed with torsion of pulmonary sequestration.

Pulmonary sequestration has been described as a congenital pulmonary malformation in which a mass of non-functioning lung tissue receives systemic arterial blood supply and does not have a demonstrable connection to the tracheobronchial tree. Pulmonary sequestrations are further divided into intralobar and extralobar sequestrations. The former is contained within the visceral pleura of another lobe, and the latter is contained in a separate pleural envelope. The extralobar sequestration is less common than the intralobar type, accounting for only 15-25% of all sequestrations.
CT is frequently used to evaluate the vascular anatomy of sequestration. Imaging findings of an extralobar sequestration include a homogeneous, well-circumcised mass of soft-tissue attenuation. Demonstration of a feeding vessel (most often from the thoracic or abdominal aorta) suggests the diagnosis of extralobar sequestration. The venous drainage is via the azygos vein, hemiazygos vein, or the IVC.

Torsion of sequestration is extremely rare. Torsion of pulmonary sequestration should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting even if the classic findings of a vascular pedicle are not demonstrated on cross-sectional imaging.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1322-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1322-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1322-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1322-4.jpg']",83,"['correct:41/83', 'diff:8/83', 'semi:6/83']"

Chest CT images show multiple small cystic or cavitary nodules in both lungs, especially upper lobes while relatively sparing of lung base. There are no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and thoracic lymphadenopathy. On chest CT 1 year ago, there was no lesion. 
In this case, the patient has been following up for rectal neuroendocrine tumor (NET), and multiple cystic nodules were newly developed when compared with previous chest CT 1 year ago. The patient was asymptomatic. His medical record revealed that he was a 30 pack-year current smoker. Through this, we could think of pulmonary LCH and cystic metastasis as a differential diagnosis. ","He underwent VATS wedge resection of the right upper and lower lobe and was finally diagnosed with pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis. On pathologic specimens, the tissue was composed of a densely cellular infiltrate of histiocytes and other inflammatory cells within the interstitium and air space. Langerhans cell aggregates were highlighted by positive immunohistochemical staining for CD1a. At higher magnification, sheets of histiocytes (arrows) with abundant pale, eosinophilic cytoplasm (arrowhead) were apparent. 

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease of unknown etiology, characterized by organ infiltration with specialized myeloid cells, which share morphological and surface receptor markers with epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs). Pulmonary LCH refers to LCH isolated to the respiratory system, notably the lungs. In adults, PLCH occurs predominantly in young smokers or ex-smokers (>90% of cases), with a peak incidence between the ages of 20 and 40 years. PLCH occurs with equal frequency in both genders.
There are for key elements concerning the pathogenesis of PLCH: (1) the mechanisms of accumulation of large numbers of CD1a+ cells in bronchiolocentric loosely formed granulomas; (2) the capacity of these granulomatous lesions to destroy and remodel surrounding tissues; (3) the reactive versus clonal/neoplastic nature of the disease; and (4) the role of smoking in adult PLCH.
The radiologic findings of pulmonary LCH vary depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis.
The radiographic findings of LCH include reticular, nodular, and reticulonodular patterns, often in combination; a cystic appearance may mimic honeycombing. Abnormalities usually are bilateral, predominantly involving the middle and upper lung zones, with relative sparing of costophrenic angles.
In the early stage of the disease, only small nodules (usually smaller than 10 mm) may be seen, with a peribronchiolar distribution. Cavitation may be present in as many as 10% of patients. The classic CT manifestation includes cysts of varying size and thickness, with scattered peribronchiolar nodules. As the disease progress, cysts predominate and appear thin-walled, an appearance very similar to that of emphysema.
Histologically, PLCH may have different appearances depending on the stage of the disease. In the early stages, lesions are predominantly cellular, with a high concentration of Langerhans cells, eosinophils, and various inflammatory cells. Langerhans cell nuclei have a typical folded appearance and are positive for CD1, S-100, and E-cadherin stains. Langerhans cells also contain Birbeck granules, which appear as pentalaminar rods or racquet-shaped inclusions at electron microscopy. As the disease progresses, the cellular component decreases and is replaced by collagen, leading to fibrosis and the “burned-out” lesion typically described as a peribronchiolar stellate scar.
Smoking cessation is of paramount importance in treating PLCH, with stabilization occurring in most patients and regression occurring in 10%–15% of patients who quit smoking. For those in whom the disease progresses, corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy may be of use.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1323-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1323-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1323-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1323-4.jpg']",86,"['correct:58/86', 'diff:9/86']"

","After the diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia through wedge resection of the left lung, the patient was tested for HIV, and the result returned positive.
Pneumocystis jiroveci is an atypical fungus that infects almost exclusively the pulmonary alveoli and causes pneumonia in immunocompromised human hosts, particularly those with a deficiency in cell-mediated immunity. Since intraalveolar macrophages serve as the primary host defense against P. jiroveci, macrophage deficiency or dysfunction can lead to infection. CD4+ T lymphocytes, which decrease during HIV infection, are essential for eradicating P. jiroveci infection. Thus, P. jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) is the most common opportunistic infection among AIDS patients. PCP occurs primarily among persons who are unaware of their HIV infection. 
Other susceptible patients include bone marrow transplant recipients, those with hematologic malignancies, those undergoing chemotherapy for malignancy, and those undergoing long-term corticosteroid therapy for inflammatory and connective tissue diseases.
 The most common symptoms of PCP are dyspnea and non-productive cough. In patients who are profoundly immunocompromised, onset may be more dramatic and resemble other pulmonary infections. However, the presentation is usually non-specific and insidious.
The diagnosis can often be confirmed with bronchoalveolar lavage. 
 Chest radiographic findings of PCP are non-specific, and one-third of infected patients may have normal radiographic findings. HRCT may be indicated in the evaluation of immunocompromised patients with normal chest radiographic findings. Features suggestive of PCP in patients with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts below 200/mm3 include small pneumatoceles, subpleural blebs, fine reticular interstitial changes, and predominantly perihilar lesions.
HRCT is sensitive and can be used to exclude PCP in patients with clinical suspicion of PCP but who have normal chest radiographs. Extensive ground-glass opacity (GGO) or GGO predominantly involving the perihilar or mid zones is the principal finding in PCP, reflecting the accumulation of intraalveolar fibrin, debris, and organisms. There may be a mid, upper, or lower zone predilection depending on whether the patient is receiving prophylactic aerosolized medication. Other features include reticular opacities, septal thickening, and pneumatocele (~30%). Pleural effusion is rare, and lymphadenopathy is uncommon (10%).
Atypical features, found more frequently in patients treated prophylactically, include consolidation, nodules, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. Consolidation is more common in patients without HIV infection and tends to develop more rapidly, reflecting pulmonary damage from the host immune response. Nodules may cavitate and usually indicate the presence of intercurrent infectious bronchiolitis from other organisms.
The cystic form of PCP is also more frequent in patients receiving prophylaxis. In this pattern, thin-walled cysts or pneumatoceles are found in both lungs with upper lobe predominance, which increases the risk of pneumothorax due to cyst rupture.
 Patients with moderate to severe infections are treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combined with corticosteroids. These agents may be used as prophylactic agents. Overall, with prompt treatment, survival is good (50%–95%), although relapses are common.

","Amyloidosis is a group of diseases resulting from the extracellular accumulation of abnormal protein in tissues and organs throughout the body. It exists as a primary disease or, more commonly, may be secondary to a wide variety of pathologic processes ranging from chronic infection or inflammation to malignancy. Patients with SLE are rarely associated with pulmonary amyloidosis (usually AA type). 
Pulmonary amyloidosis is more often a localized process instead of a part of systemic disease. Two patterns of involvement exist: the nodular parenchymal and the alveolar septal forms. Radiologic findings in both subtypes are often nonspecific.
On chest CT, nodular parenchymal amyloidosis may manifest as solitary or multiple pulmonary nodules and may mimic a variety of diseases from granulomatous disease to malignancy. Multiple pulmonary nodules are common and may exhibit smooth, lobulated, or speculated margins and occasional central or punctate calcification. Rarely, lesions may cavitate. The natural history of nodular parenchymal amyloidosis is benign. Lesions may slowly grow in size and number, but the overall prognosis is excellent and treatment is rarely required.
Alveolar septal pulmonary amyloidosis is characterized by well-defined 2-4mm micronodules accompanied by reticular opacities, interlobar septal thickening, and confluent consolidations with basal and peripheral predominance. Punctate lung calcifications, pleural effusions, and pleural thickening also may occur. Lung cysts have rarely been described, often in patients with systemic amyloidosis due to Sjogren syndrome. The cysts may be associated with calcified or noncalcified soft-tissue nodules. Whether the cysts are a manifestation of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia in the setting of Sjogren syndrome or a manifestation of amyloidosis is unclear. Compared with nodular pulmonary amyloidosis, patients with diffuse alveolar septal amyloidosis have a far worse prognosis with a median survival of 16 months.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1327-1.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1327-2.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1327-3.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1327-4.JPG', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1327-5.JPG']",115,"['correct:92/115', 'diff:8/115', 'semi:2/115']"

Figure 6. PET/CT scan reveals hypermetabolic uptake in right lower pleura, hepatic masses, and lung nodules.

The patient underwent percutaneous transthoracic biopsy at the right pleura and right pulmonary nodule, and the pathologic result was chronic inflammation and pleuritis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. The liver biopsy was also performed and pathology showed obstructive hepatopathy and acute bile ductulitis with infiltration of plasma cells and histiocytes. Some IgG4 positive cells were detected on both lung and liver biopsy specimens. Serial serum IgG4 study showed a prominent increase up to 798 mg/dL. With the diagnosis of IgG4 sclerosing disease in the multidisciplinary discussion, steroid was administered for a month. Bilateral pulmonary infiltration and pleural thickening showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scan. Serum IgG4 dropped to 177 mg/dL.
","IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a recently recognized systemic disease, characterized by tumefactive lesions with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates with abundant IgG4-positive plasma cell, storiform fibrosis, and usually elevated serum IgG4 concentrations. The lesions commonly involve multiple organs, including lungs, mediastinum, liver, and pancreas. Four patterns were observed in thoracic IgG4-RD, which include interstitium, mediastinum, airways, and pleura. In addition, it may present as a combination of these findings. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is the most common pulmonary pattern. The percentage of pulmonary involvement in IgG4-RD is uncertain. On the basis of the predominant radiologic abnormality, pulmonary IgG4-RD could be categorized into four major subtypes: solid nodular type having a solitary nodular lesion that included a mass; round-shaped ground-glass opacity (GGO) type characterized by multiple round-shaped GGOs; alveolar interstitial type showing honeycombing, bronchiectasis, and diffuse GGO; and bronchovascular type showing thickening of bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septa. Our case mainly involved thorax including lung parenchyma and pleura with bronchovascular type, which mimic lymphoproliferative disease. Although IgG4-RD is often difficult to diagnose initially, this case well demonstrates bronchovascular and interstitial distribution of lymphoplasma infiltration in thin section CT.

Computed tomography scans with a mediastinal window setting showing an enhancing well-defined prevertebral lesion continuous with the azygos vein.,"In this case, the lesion was surgically confirmed as an azygos vein aneurysm (AVA) because the differential diagnoses from the initial chest computed tomography (CT) included neurogenic tumor and bronchogenic/duplication cyst.
The normal caliber of the azygos vein is < 5 mm. A venous aneurysm of the extremity is defined as a persistent isolated focal venous dilatation with a diameter 2-fold that of the normal vein. Because AVAs are usually asymptomatic, they are mostly incidentally discovered. The clinical presentation of AVAs might be related to their morphological characteristics, and large saccular aneurysms tend to present with chest symptoms because of the mass effect in the mediastinum. Sluggish blood flow through the saccular AVA allows slow sedimentation and accumulation of thrombi within the lumen, leading to partial or eventual total thrombosis and progressive gradual enlargement of the AVA.
The differential diagnoses may include thymoma, lymphoma, congenital or acquired arterial or venous lesions, neurogenic tumors, and lymphadenopathies. Occasionally, changes in lesion size when the patient is in the upright position or during a Valsalva maneuver may suggest a central venous lesion. Transesophageal ultrasonography or venography has been used for the diagnosis of AVAs. Currently, CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are considered the primary modalities for initial noninvasive assessments of AVAs. Poor enhancement of the azygos vein on CT may lead to misinterpretation of AVAs as neurogenic tumors or lymphadenopathies. An additional delayed scan with optimal venous enhancement facilitates the diagnosis of AVAs with a patent lumen. The use of CT and MRI is also helpful for evaluating thrombi within AVAs. MRI can identify blood clots or organized hematomas of various ages within the thrombosed AVA and is particularly helpful for differentiating from neurogenic tumors or lymphadenopathies. Magnetic resonance angiography can be used to depict the global morphologic features of the venous system and to distinguish a slow-flow AVA from a solid mediastinal mass.
Although surgical or various interventional treatments of AVAs have been proposed, the guidelines are not yet clear. Nonetheless, prevention of thrombus migration and pulmonary thromboembolism during surgery is important, and this can be achieved through an initial meticulous ligation of the junction of the azygos arch and superior vena cava. Conversely, conservative management may be a reasonable approach because fusiform AVAs with a patent lumen remain stable and asymptomatic for years.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1329-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1329-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1329-3.jpg']",87,"['correct:9/87', 'diff:4/87', 'semi:4/87']"

","The patient underwent bronchoscopic biopsy of the right lower lobe, and the histopathologic evaluation showed a spindle cell lesion with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) positivity, suggesting Kaposi sarcoma (KS). The patient also had cutaneous involvement of KS in the eyelid, appearing as a nodular, red-purple elevated skin lesion.
KS is a low-grade vascular tumor that typically manifests as one of four variants: classic KS, endemic (African) KS, iatrogenic (organ transplant-related) KS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related KS. Classic KS and endemic KS rarely require radiologic evaluation because of the usually chronic course and stable skin compromise. However, iatrogenic KS and AIDS-related KS, the most common forms of the disease, are frequently disseminated or symptomatic and may require imaging studies for both diagnosis and staging. HHV-8 (or KS-associated herpesvirus) and other cofactors (e.g., cytokine-induced growth) have been linked to the development of KS. In a study of 8724 de novo malignancies in recipients of organ allografts, iatrogenic KS had a prevalence of 5.7%, with a mean development time of 21 months. Approximately 60% of patients developed nonvisceral KS confined to the skin, conjunctiva, or oropharyngeal mucosa, whereas 40% had visceral disease (i.e., involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, lymph nodes, and other visceral organs). In pulmonary KS, a characteristic finding on computed tomography is the presence of bilateral and symmetric ill-defined nodules in a peribronchovascular distribution, some of which can exhibit coalescence and progress to consolidation. Ground-glass opacities may be seen surrounding the nodules (“halo sign”). Further, axial interstitial/interlobular septal thickening, fissural nodularities, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy pleural abnormalities are also common.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1330-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1330-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1330-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1330-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1330-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1330-6.jpg']",90,"['correct:1/90', 'diff:5/90']"

Figs. 2–5. Computed tomography scans revealing multifocal GGOs and centrilobular nodules with or without dense calcification in both lungs.
","Metastatic pulmonary calcification (MPC) is a subdiagnosed metabolic lung disease that is commonly associated with end-stage renal disease. This interstitial process is characterized by the deposition of calcium salts, predominantly in the alveolar epithelial basement membrane. MPC is seen at autopsy in 60%–75% of patients with renal failure. It is often asymptomatic but can potentially progress to respiratory failure. Clinically, the degree of respiratory distress is often not correlated with the degree of macroscopic calcification. Although the factors involved in the development of the more aggressive form of MPC are not fully understood, accelerated progression of the condition after failed renal transplantation or hypercalcemia has been previously reported.
The findings of plain film radiography are nonspecific and not very useful for the diagnosis of MPC. Chest radiographs frequently show normal findings or demonstrate confluent or patchy airspace opacities. MPC can also appear as discrete or confluent calcified nodules or as a diffuse interstitial process. The relative stability of these pulmonary infiltrates, in contrast to infectious processes, and their resistance to treatment have diagnostic value. The density of opacities is not sufficiently high to suggest calcification in most reported cases, whereas the opacities are massively calcified or become progressively denser when left untreated in some cases.
Computed tomography (CT) is much more sensitive than chest radiography for detecting small amounts of calcification. Changes visible on CT are most marked in the upper zones of the lungs owing to increased alkalinity at the apices, which is conducive to the deposition of calcium salts. Although the infiltrates are histologically interstitial in nature, MPC can mimic airspace disease on CT. The most common parenchymal finding on high-resolution CT is the presence of centrilobular ground-glass nodular opacities, with numerous fluffy and poorly defined nodules 3–10 mm in diameter. These opacities may or may not contain calcification foci. A frequently associated finding is calcification in the vessels of the chest wall. The combination of pulmonary and vascular calcification is considered to be of diagnostic value for MPC.

Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) biopsy was performed for 4R, 7, and 10R lymphadenopathy. Noncaseating granulomatous inflammation was found in both TBLB and EBUS biopsy, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme level was elevated (125 U/L).
Because the patient was almost asymptomatic at the time, the clinician decided to perform observation without any treatment. Two months later, follow-up posteroanterior chest radiography showed mild improvement in hilar haziness, lymphadenopathy, and right pleural effusion.


Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder characterized by the development of noncaseating granulomas in various organs. The clinical features are often nonspecific (e.g., cough, dyspnea, and chest pain) and can be seen in 9%–19% of cases.
Thoracic involvement is common and accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Pulmonary sarcoidosis may manifest various radiologic patterns, with bilateral hilar lymph node enlargement being the most common finding, followed by interstitial lung disease. On high-resolution computed tomography, the most typical findings of pulmonary involvement are micronodules with perilymphatic distribution, fibrotic changes, and bilateral perihilar opacities. Atypical manifestations, such as mass-like or alveolar opacities, honeycomb-like cysts, miliary opacities, mosaic attenuation, tracheobronchial involvement, and pleural disease, and complications such as aspergillomas may also be seen.
Pleural plaque-like opacities are pulmonary opacities that simulate pleural plaques. Formed by multiple coalescent micronodules (granulomas), these lesions usually have well-defined irregular margins. They are bilaterally seen in regions contiguous with the pleura, mostly in the upper and middle lung zones, sometimes with associated pleural effusion.
Bone involvement is rare (approximately 5%) in sarcoidosis, and vertebral involvement is uncommon. Although sarcoidosis can involve any bones in the axial and appendicular skeleton, small bones of the hand (particularly the distal and middle phalanges of the second and third digits) are more commonly involved. On radiography, a lace-like pattern of osteolysis with thickened trabeculae and a thin cortex are characteristically seen in the small bones of the hands and feet.
Given the high probability of spontaneous resolution in patients with newly diagnosed early-stage pulmonary sarcoidosis, it may be preferable to monitor the condition without applying any specific treatment in the early stages. Patients showing progression of symptoms, worsening radiographic appearance, or decreasing pulmonary function should be considered for treatment. Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for sarcoidosis.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1332-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1332-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1332-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1332-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1332-5.jpg']",86,"['correct:17/86', 'diff:19/86']"

The patient has lived in the United States for 35 years. Surgical biopsy of the right lower lobe was performed for the diagnosis of lung disease, and the final diagnosis was confirmed to be pulmonary coccidioidomycosis.
","Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection caused by inhalation of the spores of Coccidioides species, which are endemic to the southwestern United States and arid regions of Mexico, Central America, and South America. The lungs are the target organ in coccidioidomycosis and are involved in a wide spectrum of clinical and imaging manifestations that are categorized as acute, disseminated, or chronic disease. Acute coccidioidomycosis is responsible for up to 29% of community-acquired pneumonia cases in endemic areas and is mostly self-limiting. Disseminated or chronic disease occurs in a minority of cases and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
The classic pulmonary manifestation of disseminated coccidioidal infection is the presence of miliary nodules caused by hematogenous spread. The original focus of parenchymal consolidation is occasionally seen, and hilar and mediastinal adenopathies are usually present. Lung nodules often progress to confluent opacities. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an infrequent complication that occurs in immunocompromised hosts. Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are at an increased risk of developing fungemia and ARDS. Diffuse or dependent lung opacities may be associated with ARDS. Even with antifungal and supportive therapy, these patients have a high mortality rate approaching 100%. ARDS may also occur in immunocompetent patients or in individuals with other preexisting conditions, such as diabetes or renal failure, with a mortality rate of 40%–60%.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1333-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1333-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1333-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1333-4.jpg']",97,"['correct:24/97', 'diff:21/97', 'semi:7/97']"

The patient underwent computed tomography-guided lung biopsy, and the pathologic result was granulomatous inflammation with vasculitis. He had eye pain due to filamentary keratitis, and bilateral maxillary sinusitis was noted in the paranasal sinus series. However, the serum antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test was negative.
","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is an uncommon necrotizing vasculitis that classically manifests as a clinical triad consisting of upper airway involvement, lower airway involvement, and glomerulonephritis. Because thoracic involvement is often predominant, chest radiographic findings are often the first to suggest the diagnosis. Common pulmonary radiologic findings include waxing and waning nodules, masses, ground-glass opacities, and consolidation. Airway involvement is usually indicated by circumferential tracheobronchial thickening, which can be smooth or nodular. Pleural effusion is the most common manifestation of pleural disease and can result from primary involvement or occur secondary to renal failure. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is a nonspecific finding and is usually reactive. Uncommon thoracic radiologic manifestations include involvement of the heart and great vessels. 
Ocular and orbital manifestations are common in almost half of the patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, affecting every structure of the eye, from the eyelid and orbit to the retina, choroid, and optic nerve, with a wide range of severity.
Elevation of serum cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) titers, usually directed toward proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase (found in neutrophils), occurs in up to 90% of patients with active Wegener granulomatosis. The correlation between c-ANCA and Wegener granulomatosis has been well established. Although c-ANCA testing can aid in the diagnosis, a positive result is not conclusive. Negative c-ANCA test results are not sufficient to exclude the diagnosis, and biopsy remains the standard diagnostic method.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1334-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1334-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1334-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1334-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1334-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1334-6.jpg']",92,"['correct:41/92', 'diff:24/92', 'semi:4/92']"

Figs. 2–5. Pre- and post-contrast computed tomography (CT) scans showing a 1.8-cm intraluminal polypoid nodule arising from the lateral wall with partial obstruction of the tracheal lumen.","Primary tracheal tumors are uncommon, accounting for < 0.1% of all cancer-related deaths. Most primary tracheal tumors in adults (≥ 50%) are malignant. Squamous cell carcinoma (54.5%) is the most common primary tumor of the trachea, followed by adenoid cystic carcinoma (18%).
Adenoid cystic carcinomas seem to be unrelated to smoking. There is no sex predilection, and the average age of patients is in the fifth decade. The symptoms are usually related to airway obstruction. Dyspnea and hemoptysis may also occur. Wheezing is a common symptom. Patients may be incorrectly diagnosed and treated for asthma.
The radiologic appearance of tumors can be divided into intraluminal wall thickening and exophytic forms. Intraluminal tumors are intraluminal hemispheric masses whose spread is limited to the tracheal wall. The wall thickening type manifests as diffuse wall thickening due to tumor infiltration, and the thickened part presents as either a flat or spindle-shaped mass along the tracheal wall. The exophytic form is radiologically characterized by an extratracheal tumor.
Bronchoscopy is a complementary diagnostic procedure. The chief advantage of imaging is the demonstration of tracheal wall thickening and extraluminal changes. Computed tomography (CT) is valuable for demonstrating the primary tumor and its extent. Extraluminal growth in the transverse plane, a common feature of adenoid cystic carcinomas, is observed. CT seems to be most useful for the detection of distant metastases. CT cannot predict the invasion of local structures. The use of contrast material is not useful for improving the visualization of fat planes between mediastinal tumors and the aorta. CT underestimates the extent of the tumor in the longitudinal plane. Adenoid cystic carcinomas may grow submucosally without producing a distinct mass.
Pathologically, adenoid cystic carcinomas may infiltrate through the fibrous membrane between adjacent cartilage plates into the peritracheal tissue. Perineural or intraneural infiltration, as well as pericardial, great vessel, or pulmonary hilar involvement may occur. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes may be present in 10% of cases at the initial diagnosis of the tumor. Distant metastases may develop in the lungs, liver, abdomen, lymph nodes, or bones.
The treatment of adenoid cystic carcinomas consists of surgical resection and anastomosis. The criteria for inoperability include excessive longitudinal extent, macroscopic mediastinal nodal metastases, distant metastatic deposits, and direct invasion of contiguous mediastinal structures such as the aorta and esophagus. When surgery is not indicated, usually because of extensive local disease or metastases, radiation therapy is recommended. The eventual outcome of ""curative"" surgery is difficult to predict because of the recurrent tendency of this tumor.
The 5- and 10-year survival rates are excellent (79% and 57%, respectively). However, the long-term outcome is poor owing to late local recurrences (27%) and late distant metastatic spread (55%) occurring after a median time interval of 24–180 months after surgery.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1335-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1335-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1335-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1335-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1335-5.jpg']",92,"['correct:28/92', 'diff:18/92']"

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed for the confirmation of unimproved radiologic ground-glass opacity (GGO) findings. The surgical specimen was positive for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, leading to the final diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). After bronchoalveolar lavage treatment, the radiologic findings improved on the follow-up chest computed tomography (CT) and chest posteroanterior radiography, and PAP did not recur for 7 years. 
PAP is a rare disease characterized by abnormal intra-alveolar accumulation of lipoproteins (1, 2). Three distinct subgroups of PAP are currently recognized: idiopathic, secondary, and congenital (3). Secondary PAP (5%–10% of cases) is recognized in patients with inhalation exposure to industrial materials such as silica particles, cement dust, aluminum dust, titanium dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and fiberglass; in those with underlying hematologic malignancies; or in those with immunodeficiency disorders (including cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy and human immunodeficiency virus infection) (3). Our case was considered a secondary form caused by the recent heavy exposure to dust. PAP was originally defined by histopathologic findings of amorphous PAS-positive lipoproteinaceous materials filling the alveoli, with a relatively normal background lung architecture.
The “crazy-paving” pattern on CT is defined as a network of smoothly thickened reticular (septal) lines superimposed on areas of GGO. Areas of crazy-paving in PAP are typically widespread and bilateral, often with sharply marginated regions of geographic or lobular sparing. Crazy-paving has a broad radiologic differential diagnosis, including left heart failure, pneumonia (especially pneumocystis pneumonia), alveolar hemorrhage, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, diffuse alveolar damage (adult respiratory distress syndrome), radiation- or drug-induced pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.
In unusual cases, clinical remission or quiescence of PAP may occur; however, intervention is required in most patients, and the treatment depends on the particular form of the disease (3). Standard treatment includes therapeutic whole-lung bronchoalveolar lavage to remove alveolar material. Supplementation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor has been used, with varying effectiveness (1, 2, 3).","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1336-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1336-2.jpg']",91,"['correct:65/91', 'diff:9/91']"

","The patient had a fracture in the right femoral neck due to a slip down.
Bronchoalveolar lavage analysis revealed oil red O-positive lipid globules in histiocytes (fat embolism clinically).
Fat embolism is an infrequent complication of long bone fractures, occurring in 1%–3% of patients with simple tibial or femoral fractures but in up to 20% of patients with more severe trauma. Its less common causes include hemoglobinopathy, major burns, pancreatitis, overwhelming infection, tumors, blood transfusion, and liposuction.
The first mechanism is the production of free fatty acids, which initiate a toxic and inflammatory reaction in the endothelium. Vessel wall permeability is increased, and extravasations, interstitial hemorrhage, and alveolar wall damage with passage of blood and fat microglobules into the alveoli occur. The second mechanism is the mechanical obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature by fat globules and aggregates of red blood cells and platelets.
A combination of pulmonary, cerebral, and cutaneous symptoms typically occurs within 12–24 h of the traumatic event. Chest imaging shows bilateral homogeneous and heterogeneous opacities and resolves within 1 week. The time interval between the traumatic event and radiographic abnormalities is usually 1–2 days, which allows differentiation from traumatic contusion. 
The radiographic findings resemble those of acute respiratory distress syndrome from any cause and consist of widespread homogeneous and heterogeneous areas of increased opacity.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1338-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1338-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1338-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1338-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1338-5.jpg']",97,"['correct:77/97', 'diff:1/97', 'semi:1/97']"

Fig. 6. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography image showing avidly increased uptake of FDG in the infiltrative lesion in the right atrium.","Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare sporadic non-Langerhans cell histiocytic (LCH) proliferative disorder with systemic predilection. It usually affects adults in the fifth to seventh decades of life, with a slight male predilection. It has nonspecific clinical manifestations depending on the site of involvement. Constitutional symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and night sweats, are common. Overall, the skeletal system is the most common site of involvement, leading to bone pain, which is the presenting manifestation in nearly 96% of cases. The most common extraosseous manifestations are central diabetes insipidus and exophthalmos.
The clinical, radiologic, and light microscopic findings may be indistinguishable from those of LCH. It is often suspected in the presence of characteristic radiologic findings and is subsequently confirmed by histopathology.
Histopathologically, ECD is characterized by tissue infiltration by lipid-laden histiocytes. The demonstration of CD68 positivity in xanthogranulomatous histiocytic infiltrates with a simultaneous lack of CD1a and Birbeck granules is confirmatory, thereby aiding in differentiating ECD from LCH.
Imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up. Plain radiography and technetium-99m bone scintigraphy are useful in determining skeletal involvement. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging are useful for the evaluation of thoracoabdominal and central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT is invaluable for the in vivo determination of disease activity during follow-up.
The lung parenchyma and pleura are affected in approximately 40%–50% of cases. Parenchymal involvement may be interstitial, alveolar, or combined. Patients tend to remain asymptomatic or may have progressive dyspnea or cough. The most frequent finding on CT is smooth interlobular and intralobular septal thickening. However, many other nonspecific findings, such as centrilobular nodules, cysts, consolidation, ground-glass attenuation, or pleural effusion, may also be observed. Septal thickening due to histiocytic infiltration has a lymphangitic distribution involving the peribronchovascular bundle, interlobular septa, and visceral pleura. Pleuroparenchymal involvement on imaging may be indistinguishable from other interstitial lung diseases such as LCH, sarcoidosis, pulmonary edema, or veno-occlusive disease. Interstitial involvement in ECD culminates in pulmonary fibrosis, leading to respiratory failure.
The appendicular skeleton, especially the long bones of the lower extremities, is a predilection site for ECD involvement. On plain radiographs, a characteristic symmetrical bilateral cortical sclerosis affecting the metaphyses and/or diaphyses of the long tubular bones is observed (Fig. 1). In certain cases, the lesions may be either mixed lytic–sclerotic or purely lytic, which may be radiologically indistinguishable from LCH.
Orbital involvement is frequent in ECD, leading to exophthalmos, which is usually bilaterally symmetrical.
Cardiovascular involvement is frequent in ECD and is seen in nearly three-fourths of cases. Although any part of the heart may be affected, the pericardium is the most commonly involved site. Pericardial involvement leads to pericardial thickening and effusion. Myocardial infiltration more frequently involves the right heart, especially the right atrium and atrioventricular groove. On imaging, there is a plaque-like, infiltrative, smooth thickening of the pericardium and/or myocardium that may involve the septum and valves.
Plaque-like perivascular soft tissue encircling the aorta and its branches is also observed in ECD.
The retroperitoneum including the kidneys is the most common extraosseous site of involvement.
CNS involvement is usually extra-axial, contiguous with the facial or orbital bones and may extend to the adjacent brain parenchyma. 
ECD may potentially involve any site, including the skin, breast, lymph nodes, thyroid gland, testis, and visceral organs.
Despite being a nonmalignant entity, ECD can be fatal owing to organ dysfunction. Involvement of particular sites, such as the CNS and cardiovascular system, affects the prognosis based on the observed poor response to chemotherapy. Although therapeutic advances have lowered morbidity, the impact on mortality remains dismal, with reported 1- and 5-year overall survival rates of 96% and 68%, respectively.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1340-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1340-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1340-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1340-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1340-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1340-6.jpg']",83,"['correct:9/83', 'diff:9/83']"

","Paraquat (PQ; N,N'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride) is a highly toxic organic material that was previously used as an herbicide. Paraquat has toxic effects on the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Death from paraquat poisoning is primarily caused by progressive pulmonary damage and respiratory failure. In the past, paraquat intoxication was a serious public health problem, with an estimated annual incidence of 2000 toxic ingestions associated with a mortality rate of 60%–70% in some Asian countries. Paraquat is a widely used suicide agent in developing countries because of its widespread availability, low toxic dose, and relatively low cost. It is currently banned in many countries, including South Korea. The prognosis is generally associated with the degree of exposure. The toxic effects of paraquat result from oxygen radicals that destroy the cell membrane. Organ-specific damage to the lungs is caused by both lower concentrations of antioxidants and higher concentrations of oxygen within the lungs. Early pathologic findings in the lung include edema-related thickening of the alveolar walls, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Some of the alveoli become filled with fluid and large amounts of fibrin. Late pathologic findings include pulmonary fibrosis and microcysts. The most common pattern on computed tomography (CT) in acute paraquat poisoning is ground-glass attenuation, mostly bilateral and diffuse in distribution. Consolidation and irregular lines can also be observed on CT. On follow-up scans, the ground-glass attenuation changes to consolidation with bronchiectasis. Additional irregular lines and traction bronchiectasis can also be observed. In this case, the patient survived and showed the fibrotic sequelae of paraquat-induced lung injury.

","Gestational trophoblastic neoplasms comprise a heterogeneous group of trophoblastic tumors including choriocarcinomas, epithelioid trophoblastic tumors (ETTs), and placental site trophoblastic tumors. ETTs are extremely rare. They originate from intermediate trophoblastic cells of the chorion laeve. The uterus is the primary site of ETTs (40%), followed by the cervix (31%). The lung is the most common extrauterine site, accounting for 19% of the cases. Very few ETTs show aggressive clinical behavior, and the sites of metastases include the lung, small bowel, fallopian tube, broad ligament, and endocervix. Although ETTs are most commonly associated with prior term deliveries (43%), they have also been associated with molar pregnancies (39%) and abortions (18%) occurring 2–300 months (mean 76 months) after the antecedent gestational event. One possible pathogenesis of this rare clinical phenomenon is the original transformation of trophoblastic cells that were passed to the lungs during the antecedent pregnancy. Another hypothesis is that pulmonary lesions may be the consequence of spontaneous resolution of an antecedent uterine ETT. Both intrauterine and extrauterine ETTs cause elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels, although the hCG levels are < 2500 mIU/mL in 69% of the cases. Whereas choriocarcinomas are chemosensitive, ETTs are relatively chemoresistant. Therefore, surgical resection remains the primary treatment modality. Lewin et al. reported three cases of isolated pulmonary lesions with elevated hCG levels but with no evidence of uterine disease. All three patients underwent lung resection and hysterectomy, and the pathology report supported the diagnosis of isolated pulmonary ETT. Although only two patients received adjunctive chemotherapy, all three patients were alive without evidence of disease after the surgical resection of the tumor. With the accurate diagnosis of ETT, chemotherapy has largely been reserved for the treatment of metastatic, recurrent, or surgically unresectable disease.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1343-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1343-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1343-3.jpg']",101,"['correct:2/101', 'diff:6/101', 'semi:48/101']"

Treatment consists of antibiotics and urgent surgery. The overall mortality rate is 16%–40% but has been reported to be as high as 67%. Saccular aneurysm, rapid expansion or development, and soft-tissue mass, stranding, and/or fluid in an unusual location are imaging findings that are highly suspicious for infected aortic aneurysm. Periaortic gas and adjacent vertebral body changes are helpful features, although they occur infrequently. It is important to rule out aortic pathology if a patient presents with rapidly expanding infiltrates close to the mediastinum.

Follow up chest radiograph after amiodarone discontinuation showing decreased interval change of the previously noted interstitial markings and GGOs in both lungs.","Amiodarone is an iodinated benzofuran derivative used to suppress ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Pulmonary toxicity is one of the most serious adverse effects of amiodarone. Several forms of pulmonary disease occur among patients treated with amiodarone, including interstitial pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary nodules and solitary masses, and pleural effusion. Other adverse effects of amiodarone include photosensitivity, blue-gray discoloration of the skin, thyroid dysfunction, corneal deposits, liver dysfunction, and bone marrow suppression.
Interstitial pneumonitis is the most common presentation of amiodarone-induced pulmonary disease. Interstitial pneumonitis usually presents after ≥ 2 months of therapy, especially in patients whose amiodarone dose exceeds 400 mg/day. 
On chest radiography, interstitial pneumonitis due to amiodarone typically shows new, diffuse or localized, reticular, ground-glass, or mixed opacities. These changes may be migratory and can occur in the absence of symptoms. Pleural effusion is rare.
The computed tomography (CT) images of patients with amiodarone-induced interstitial pneumonitis may show areas of high attenuation in the lungs, liver, and spleen owing to the accumulation of iodinated amiodarone in tissue macrophages. Although this finding is specific to amiodarone use, it is not necessary for the diagnosis of amiodarone pneumonitis and may be seen in the absence of lung toxicity. Other high-resolution CT findings related to amiodarone-induced interstitial pneumonitis include diffuse (usually bilateral) ground-glass opacities and septal thickening. Honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis can also be seen.
The treatment of amiodarone-induced interstitial pneumonitis primarily consists of stopping amiodarone and, in more symptomatic patients, initiating systemic glucocorticoids. Owing to the accumulation of amiodarone in fatty tissues and its long elimination half-life (approximately 45 days), pulmonary toxicity may initially progress despite drug discontinuation.
Amiodarone is not recommended in patients who have recovered from amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity because of the risk of recurrent disease and progressive pulmonary fibrosis.

Malignant neoplasm is a rare complication of chronic empyema and is likely to occur after more than 5years of chronic empyema. Malignant lymphoma is the most common malignant cell type associated with chronic empyema. Most pyothorax-associated lymphoma (PAL) are non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma with diffuse large B cell type. 
The diagnosis of PAL is difficult in most cases because the tumor frequently shows extensive necrosis or cystic degeneration that simulates the exacerbation of empyema or empyema necessitans. 
Extensive tumor necrosis may be related to the fact that most PALs are high-grade. To differentiate malignancy from empyema necessitans, it is important to examine the shape of a mass with soft-tissue attenuation, particularly concerning the irregular wall thickness and the existence of projections in the cavity. Another helpful CT finding for differential diagnosis is bony destruction.

","The patient underwent surgical resection of the right upper lobe because of uncontrolled hemoptysis. Microbiological analysis of the surgical specimen revealed Nocardia species.
Nocardia is a genus of filamentous gram-positive, weakly acid-fast, aerobic bacteria found in dust, soil, water, decaying vegetation, and stagnant matter. Lung infection can occur through direct inhalation of Nocardia, which accounts for 73%–77% of all infection cases. Although pulmonary nocardiosis often occurs in immunocompromised patients, especially in those with impaired cell immunity related to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and transplantation, one-third of patients with nocardiosis have normal immunity. Norcardia species are one of the known causes of opportunistic infections in Cushing’s syndrome. A series of case reports have described Nocardia species infection in patients with endogenous and ectopic Cushing’s syndrome.
The computed tomographic findings are diverse and nonspecific; however, the most common findings are consolidation and nodules/masses, which may progress to cavitation in some cases. Furthermore, in > 60%, cavitations occur within 2 weeks. Central low attenuation, centrilobular nodules, bronchial wall thickening, and septal line thickening have also been reported. Nocardia invades and colonizes the respiratory tracts, thereby causing bronchopneumonia. Therefore, findings suggestive of bronchopneumonia, such as bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular nodules, can be observed in patients with nocardial pneumonia.
In some clinical settings, such as in immunocompromised patients or in those with some underlying diseases, consolidation or nodules/masses with cavitation may suggest the possibility of pulmonary nocardiosis.

","Myeloid sarcoma, also known as granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma, is a solid tumor of extramedullary localization composed of malignant primitive myeloid cells. Its occurrence is linked with acute myeloid leukemia and less commonly in those with chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or other myeloproliferative disorders. The prevalence of myeloid sarcoma varied from 2.5% to 9% in AML patients. Mediastinal myeloid sarcoma can be in the form of discrete masses or more commonly as diffusely infiltrating soft tissue which may have trans-compartmental involvement and is frequently mistaken for lymphoma on imaging. Lung manifestations consist of alveolar opacities, nodules, or interstitial septal lines. In general, myeloid sarcoma masses were isodense to muscle on CT scans, and isointense and hyperintense (mild to moderate) on T1- and T2-weighted MR images, respectively. Diffusion-weighted images might be a useful diagnostic tool for myeloid sarcoma evaluation, because of the high cellularity in these lesions.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1349-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1349-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1349-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1349-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1349-5.jpg']",96,"['correct:3/96', 'diff:6/96', 'semi:13/96']"

","Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease that is mediated by an inflammatory reaction to inhalation of antigens in susceptible individuals. More than 200 different antigens have been associated with the development of HP, including plant products, animal products, aerosolized microorganisms, and organic chemicals. Most cases of HP develop only after many years of continuous or intermittent inhalation of the inciting agent. HP has been classically divided into acute, subacute, and chronic types according to disease duration at the time of presentation. More recently, it has been divided into fibrotic and nonfibrotic HP.
The common symptoms in both nonfibrotic and fibrotic HP include dyspnea, cough, and chirping rales. Less commonly, constitutional symptoms, such as weight loss and flu-like symptoms, may be present. The onset may be acute or insidious, and the episodes may be recurrent.
The histopathologic process consists of chronic inflammation of the bronchi and peribronchiolar tissue, often with poorly defined granulomas and giant cells in the interstitium or alveoli. Fibrosis and emphysema may develop later.
In nonfibrotic HP, the radiologic findings include diffuse ground-glass opacification, centrilobular ground-glass opacities, air trapping, and lung cysts. These findings are usually bilateral and symmetric with a diffuse distribution. Lung fibrosis and signs of bronchiolar obstruction are highly suggestive of fibrotic HP. Fibrosis manifests as irregular fine or coarse reticulation with architectural lung distortion. Septal thickening, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing can occur. Lung fibrosis is most severe in the middle portion of the lungs or equally distributed in the three lung zones with relative basal sparing. Bronchiolar obstruction is also observed in computed tomography as a combination of three patterns (ground-glass opacities, lobules of decreased attenuation and vascularity, and normal-appearing lung).

","Amyloidosis is a rare disorder of protein folding, and the amyloid deposits consist mainly of protein fibrils. The most important proteins are amyloid L and amyloid A. Amyloidosis affects the respiratory tract in approximately 50% of the cases. Amyloidosis can involve the lung parenchyma, trachea, bronchi, mediastinum, pleura, and heart. Histologic examination reveals amyloid deposits in subepithelial interstitial tissues, which show a characteristic apple-green birefringence when stained with Congo red and examined under polarizing microscopy.
Tracheobronchial amyloidosis typically manifests after the fifth decade of life, with dyspnea, cough, and occasionally hemoptysis or asthma-like symptoms.
Most of the patients show normal chest radiographic findings. However, focal or diffuse thickening of the airway with luminal narrowing can be seen. The findings of tracheobronchial amyloidosis on computed tomography include thickening of the airway wall with associated narrowing of the lumen and, in some cases, calcification foci. Wall thickening may be focal or diffuse and nodular, plaque-like, or circumferential. Tracheobronchial amyloidosis is generally confined to the trachea but can extend to the main, lobar, and segmental bronchi, and bronchial involvement is frequently associated with distal atelectasis, bronchiectasis, or air trapping. However, these imaging findings are nonspecific, and the differential diagnoses include a variety of diseases, such as relapsing polychondritis and tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica.

","The patient was a smoker with a smoking history of 60 pack-years. Surgical lung biopsy was performed in the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. The biopsied lung showed diffuse intra-alveolar macrophage accumulation and mild interstitial thickening. The architecture of the lung was relatively well preserved. The histopathologic findings suggested desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP).
DIP is an uncommon form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia that primarily affects cigarette smokers in their fourth or fifth decade. Approximately 90% of patients with DIP are smokers. DIP can occasionally be seen in nonsmokers in association with systemic disorders, infections, and exposure to occupational or environmental agents or drugs. DIP is characterized by the accumulation of numerous pigmented macrophages within most of the distal airspaces of the lung and, occasionally, the presence of giant cells.
Chest radiography has a low sensitivity in the detection of DIP and is reported to yield normal findings in 3%–22% of biopsy-proven cases. The radiologic patterns are nonspecific and include patchy ground-glass opacities with a lower lung and peripheral predominance.
The common computed tomographic findings of DIP include bilateral areas of ground-glass opacity with peripheral basal predominance, which may reflect the filling of alveolar airspaces by macrophages. Irregular and linear opacities and reticular patterns are frequently observed in the base of the lung (59%); however, honeycombing is uncommon. Coexistent emphysema may be present. Traction bronchiectasis and small cystic spaces may develop within the areas of ground-glass opacity, which may suggest dilated bronchioles and alveolar ducts.

Fig. 6. Surgical specimen showing a mass with extensive hemorrhage, hematoma, necrosis, and calcifications, consistent with arteriovenous hemangioma.
","Hemangioma is a rare, benign vascular tumor that accounts for < 0.5% of all mediastinal masses. It has been speculated that hemangiomas represent either true neoplasms or developmental vascular anomalies. Histologically, these tumors consist of large interconnecting vascular spaces lined by flattened cuboidal epithelium along with varying amounts of interspersed stromal elements, such as fat, myxoid, and fibrinous tissues. They are categorized as capillary, cavernous, or venous hemangiomas based on the size of the vascular spaces. Most mediastinal hemangiomas are found in the anterior mediastinum; however, a few arise in the posterior mediastinum.
Mediastinal hemangiomas usually manifest as nonspecific soft-tissue masses. Phleboliths, multiple enhanced vessels, and peripheral puddling of contrast enhancement may be potential diagnostic features. Phleboliths, a potentially diagnostic finding, are seen in only 10% of conventional radiographs. Punctate calcification is more common and needs to be differentiated from the calcification seen in patients with teratoma or cartilaginous tumors.
Hemangiomas commonly appear as heterogeneous lesions on unenhanced computed tomography (CT). Their appearance depends on the stromal content and the degree of thrombosed vascular channels. The pattern of contrast enhancement varies, including central, mixed central and peripheral, peripheral, and nonspecific increased attenuation. Gradually increasing and persistent enhancement has been seen on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT. Large draining veins have also been observed in delayed images.
In our case, the hemangioma showed peripheral punctate calcifications, consistent with phleboliths. Early arterial-phase CT showed poor enhancement of the mass; however, follow-up enhanced CT showed a prominent peripheral enhancement pattern with an unusual contrast extravasation pattern. The differential diagnoses included vessel aneurysm; however, there was no direct communication between the mass and the adjacent vessel.

He was positive for the anti-myeloperoxidase antibody (perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA]), but negative for the anti-proteinase 3 antibody (cytoplasmic ANCA), IgE M3 (for Aspergillus), and IgE P4 (for Anisakis). An eosinophil level of 65% was found on differential cell count of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Microscopic hematuria was detected in urine.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) has been defined as the presence of eosinophil‐rich and granulomatous inflammation involving the respiratory tract and necrotizing vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels. It is associated with asthma and eosinophilia. ANCA is more frequent in the presence of glomerulonephritis (Revised International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference, 2012). 
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is characterized by systemic vasculitis involving multiple organs, with upper airway disease and pulmonary abnormalities being the most common manifestations. The most common radiographic findings are transient, patchy, and nonsegmental opacities. The common abnormalities on high-resolution computed tomography are small nodules, ground-glass opacities, bronchial wall thickening or dilatation, consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, and mosaic perfusion.

Histopathologic examination showed chronic inflammation with diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and fibrosis. Immunoglobulin (Ig)G4 immunostaining revealed abundant IgG4-positive plasma cells in the specimen (> 60 per high-power field and IgG4/IgG ratio > 80%). The serum IgG level was 2,322 mg/dL (normal range: 700–1,600 mg/dL), and the IgG4 subclass level was 293.7 mg/L (normal range: 15–157 mg/L).
IgG4-related disease (also called IgG4-related sclerosing disease, IgG4-related systemic disease, or hyper-IgG4 disease) is a systemic fibroinflammatory disease associated with elevated circulating levels of IgG4. 
Intrathoracic involvement in IgG4-related disease has been described in the lung parenchyma, airways, pleura, and mediastinum. Inoue et al. described four subtypes of lung parenchymal involvement: solid nodular type, round-shaped ground-glass opacity (GGO) type, alveolar interstitial type, and bronchovascular type. Solid nodular and round GGO lesions can mimic primary lung cancer. The alveolar interstitial type is characterized by diffuse GGO, bronchiectasis, and honeycombing, which are suggestive of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. The bronchovascular type is characterized by thickening of the bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septa, often associated with lymph node swelling in the hilum and mediastinum. Sarcoidosis or lymphoproliferative disorder is suspected on radiologic examination.
The most common intrathoracic manifestations may be mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathies. Fibrosing mediastinitis is an unusual mediastinal manifestation of IgG4-related diseases. Airway manifestations include tracheobronchial stenosis or extrinsic compression of the central airways due to fibrosing mediastinitis and bronchiectasis. Pleural disease has been reported as nodular lesions in the visceral or parietal pleura, and pleural effusion is an uncommon feature in patients with IgG4-related disease.
In our case, the patient showed typical CT features of IgG4-related disease, including lung parenchymal involvement (nodular and alveolar interstitial types) and mediastinal involvement.
Serum IgG4 levels are elevated in most patients with IgG4-related lung disease. Pathologically, it is characterized by diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, fibrosis, and IgG4 immunostaining positivity. Intrathoracic IgG4-related disease generally responds well to steroid treatment; however, azathioprine, methotrexate, or rituximab therapy could be applied to steroid-resistant IgG4-related lung disease.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1356-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1356-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1356-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1356-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1356-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1356-6.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1356-7.jpg']",89,"['correct:5/89', 'diff:30/89']"

Infiltration of organ systems by IgG4-positive plasma cells and lymphocytes leads to fibrosis and tumefactive lesions. The classic histopathologic features include dense lymphocytic infiltration, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis with abundant IgG4-positive cells. In computed tomography scans, IgG4-related mediastinal disease appears as lymphadenopathy or anterior mediastinal mass, which can be confused with lymphoma.
Multiple cases in which lymphoma occurred in patients with IgG4-RD have been reported. However, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that may potentially contribute to lymphomagenesis in IgG4-RD are not well defined. In a case series of eight lymphomas occurring in patients with IgG4-RD, the tumors were mostly low-grade B-cell lymphomas with predilection for extranodal sites.
In the present case, anterior mediastinal mass excision was performed, and IgG4-RD was diagnosed in May 2019. The patient had been treated with intravenous steroids (prednisone)  since May 2019. Azathioprine was added in November 2019. Despite the treatment, new soft-tissue masses and enlarged lymph nodes developed in the thorax. Core needle biopsy of the right axillary lymph node and excisional biopsy of the right paratracheal lymph node revealed T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Excisional biopsy of the mass in the right internal mammary chain was also performed, and atypical lymphocyte infiltrations were observed, which were suggestive of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma.
Azathioprine is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma development. However, considering that azathioprine was used for < 2 months, it is presumed that azathioprine use was not the cause of lymphoma in this case.

Involvement of the respiratory system in SLE is relatively common. SLE can affect the pleura, lung, and respiratory muscles, all contributing to respiratory dysfunction. 
Pleural effusions are the most common manifestation of SLE in the respiratory system and are bilateral in approximately 50% of patients. Pleural effusions in SLE are generally small and are exudative, containing lupus erythematosus cells, immune complexes, and anti-DNA antibodies, among other things. Pleuritis and pleural fibrosis are reported in 50%–83% of SLE patients in some autopsy series. Although an isolated pleural effusion is a nonspecific radiographic finding, its presence, particularly when chronic, may suggest SLE when clinical evaluation suggests an underlying autoimmune process. Bloody pleural effusions are also common in SLE. The differential diagnosis includes tuberculous pleural effusion, parapneumonic effusion, and malignant effusion. Diagnostic thoracentesis under ultrasonographic (US) or CT guidance may aid in differentiating between pleural effusions from SLE and pleural effusions from other causes, especially when they are new or large, enabling prompt initiation of treatment with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents.

","Clinical course of the patient
The patient underwent VATS lung biopsy of the right upper lobe and was finally diagnosed with pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis. On pathologic specimens, the tissue was composed of multinodular fibrosis with many eosinophils and Langerhans cell infiltration. Langerhans cell aggregates were highlighted by positive immunohistochemical staining for CD1a.

Brief Discussion
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease of unknown etiology, characterized by organ infiltration with specialized myeloid cells, which share morphological and surface receptor markers with epidermal Langerhans cells. Pulmonary LCH refers to LCH isolated to the respiratory system, notably the lungs. The prevalence of pulmonary LCH is unknown but may account for about 3-5% of all adult diffuse lung diseases. In adults, pulmonary LCH occurs predominantly in young smokers on ex-smokers, with a peak incidence between the ages of 20 and 40 years. Pulmonary LCH occurs with equal frequency in both genders.
The radiologic findings of pulmonary LCH vary depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Chest x-ray often shows bilateral, and generally symmetric reticulo-micronodular changes, in which cysts may sometimes be identified, predominantly involving the upper and middle lung fields. Chest CT characteristically demonstrates a combination of nodules, cavitating nodules measuring 1-10 mm in diameter and thick-walled or thin-walled cysts. Cysts vary in size and may coalesce to form irregular shapes. Lesions are predominantly located in the upper and middle lung fields with relative sparing of the basal lungs. In the early stage of the disease, nodules and cavitary nodules are more numerous than lung cysts, while more advanced disease is often cystic in appearance. 
Patients with pulmonary LCH show variable and uncertain clinical courses. Up to one-half will show clinical and radiographic stability, while up to 25% will demonstrate spontaneous regression. The remaining 25% can have the continued cystic replacement of lung parenchyma that may progress to end-stage lung disease.

Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders that are characterized by the location of malignant T-lymphocytes in the skin at presentation. The classic subsets of this disease are mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome. Patients’ immunocompromised status leads to death from opportunistic infection or sepsis. In its later stages, mycosis fungoides can cause peripheral lymphadenopathy and may progress to widespread extra cutaneous visceral involvement. The lungs are among the most common sites of visceral involvement and its incidence is less than 1% of all patients with CTCL.
Patients with lung involvement of CTCL have few respiratory symptoms and presented with nodular disease on chest radiograph that progressed over time.

This patient had taken Omega-3 oil for 5 to 6 years.","Lipoid pneumonia is uncommon and, although it is difficult to determine the precise clinical incidence, autopsy series have reported a frequency of only 1.0–2.5%. However, it is important to be aware of the various radiologic manifestations of lipoid pneumonia because, in the appropriate clinical setting, these findings can be diagnostic. Lipoid pneumonia can be either exogenous or endogenous in cause based on the source of the lipid. Exogenous lipoid pneumonia usually occurs when animal fats or mineral or vegetable oils are aspirated or inhaled, whereas endogenous lipoid pneumonia results from lipid accumulation within intraalveolar macrophages in the setting of bronchial obstruction, chronic pulmonary infection, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, or fat storage diseases. The development of parenchymal abnormalities in exogenous lipoid pneumonia is dependent on the type, amount, frequency, and length of time of aspirated or inhaled oils or fats. Mineral oil (a mixture of inert, long-chain, saturated hydrocarbons obtained from petroleum) and vegetable-based oils tend to cause minimal to mild inflammatory reactions. On the contrary, animal fats are hydrolyzed by lung lipases into free fatty acids that trigger a severe inflammatory reaction that manifests as focal edema and intraalveolar hemorrhage.
Acute exogenous lipoid pneumonia can manifest radiologically within 30 minutes of the episode of aspiration or inhalation, and pulmonary opacities can be seen in most patients within 24 hours. The opacities are typically ground-glass or consolidative, bilateral, and segmental or lobar in distribution and predominantly involve the middle and lower lobes. Other manifestations of acute exogenous lipoid pneumonia include poorly marginated nodules, pneumatoceles, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and pleural effusions. Pneumatoceles usually occur within regions of ground-glass or consolidative opacities, typically manifest radiologically within 2–30 days after aspiration or inhalation, and are more common in patients who have aspirated or inhaled a large amount of mineral oils or petroleum-based products. 
The radiologic manifestations of acute exogenous lipoid pneumonia typically improve or resolve over time. Resolution of opacities is variable and usually occurs within 2 weeks to 8 months. Typically, resolution is complete, although minimal scarring can occur. Similar to acute exogenous lipoid pneumonia, chronic exogenous lipoid pneumonia most frequently manifests as ground-glass or consolidative opacities involving one or more segments, typically with a peribronchovascular distribution and predominant involvement of the lower lobes. Additionally, ground-glass opacities with associated interlobular septal thickening (crazy-paving pattern) with a basilar predominance have also been described.

Fig 2-4. CT scans reveal heterogeneously enhancing subpleural consolidation with internal low attenuated portion in right middle lobe. 
","The patient underwent a CT-guided lung biopsy and the lesion was pathologically confirmed as paragonimiasis.
Pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis is a parasitic infection caused by lung flukes including Paragonimus westermani. Paragonimiasis usually occurs from ingestion of raw or improperly cooked freshwater crabs or crayfish. Pleural or lung parenchymal lesions are commonly found on CT or chest radiographs, and radiologic manifestations of pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis vary with the stage of the disease. 
Pulmonary paragonimiasis manifests as focal air-space consolidation, ground-glass opacities in the early stage, which may show the change in location on follow-up CT. When the parasite sac communicates with the bronchus, it appears as a cavitary lesion; On the other hand, if the parasite sac does not communicate with the bronchus, it appears as air-space consolidation or nodule with an internal low attenuated portion. When the peripheral or subpleural consolidation or nodule shows an internal low attenuated portion, it can be helpful to diagnose paragonimiasis, such as in our case. In addition, linear opacity elongated from the pleura can be a helpful diagnostic clue. In the later stage, thin-walled cyst or bronchiectasis can be observed.
Pleural paragonimiasis manifests as focal pleural thickening, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, hemothorax, and empyema. Focal pleural thickening usually appears adjacent to parenchymal lesions, which can be helpful to diagnose paragonimiasis.
Although the symptoms and signs of pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis are nonspecific, an early diagnosis can be made if radiologists understand the pathogenesis and typical imaging findings of the disease.

","There was no significant mucosal abnormality on bronchoscopy. On EBUS-TBNA, soft tissue lesion with heterogeneous echogenicity was observed, and EBUS-bronchoscopic biopsy was done. Pathologic diagnosis was confirmed as “adenoid cystic carcinoma.”

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) occurs mainly in the salivary glands or central airways, such as the trachea and the main bronchi. It is a low-grade malignancy that is the second most common tracheal malignancy at histology (33%) after squamous cell carcinoma (48%). ACC has an equal sex distribution and commonly occurs in the 4th and 5th decades of life.
ACCs usually arise in the lower trachea, and others are found in the mainstem bronchi, lobar bronchi, or rarely in the segmental bronchi and extrathoracic trachea. ACC have a tendency toward submucosal extension and manifest with circumferential and infiltrative growth. Because of its submucosal origin, it tends to have an intact epithelium and a smooth contour. 
On CT, the tumor manifests as an intraluminal mass with extension through the tracheal wall, a diffuse or circumferential wall thickening of the trachea, a soft-tissue mass filing the airway, or a homogenous mass encircling the trachea with wall thickening in the transverse and longitudinal planes. Shapes and margins are variable: polypoid or broad-based and smooth, lobulated, or irregular.
On a previous study, ACC showed variable FDG uptake depending on the grade of differentiation; however, avid (maximum SUV > 6) and homogeneous FDG uptake were found in the high- and intermediate-grade tumors rather than the low-grade tumors.

","Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) is a rare form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). It is associated with heavy smoking. A diagnosis of DIP cannot be reliably established based on clinical and radiological features alone and ideally requires a lung biopsy. The histomorphology is characterized by the diffuse accumulation of numerous pigmented macrophages within most of the distal airspace of the lung and, sometimes, an admixture of eosinophils and/or giant cells. 
The radiologic patterns are nonspecific and include patchy ground-glass opacities with a lower lung and peripheral predominance. The predominant abnormality at high-resolution CT in patients with DIP is ground-glass opacity, which may be peripheral, patchy, or diffuse in distribution. A peripheral subpleural and basal predominance of ground-glass opacity is most commonly seen. Honeycombing is uncommon. Coexistent emphysema may be present. At follow-up high-resolution CT of patients receiving treatment, the ground-glass opacity may show partial or complete resolution. Small cystic spaces may develop within the areas of ground-glass opacity, although progression to reticular abnormality and honeycombing is unusual. The differential diagnosis includes RB-ILD, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, NSIP, and atypical infections such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an inheritable multiorgan disease. MMPH is a manifestation of TSC with a hamartomatous process of the lung that exhibits multiple tiny pulmonary nodules. Pathologically, it is characterized by the proliferation of type II pneumocystis along the alveolar septa. MMPH can occur in patients with or without lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), predominantly in female patients.
The clinical manifestations resulting from isolated MMPH are dyspnea, cough, and mild to moderate hypoxemia. The clinical course of MMPH is usually not progressive and treatment is unnecessary.
Radiologically, MMPH presents as multiple nodules on CT. Nodules are 1-8mm in diameter and are diffusely scattered throughout the lung in a random distribution with regard to the secondary lobule. The differential diagnosis should also include a miliary granulomatous infection, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, hematogenous metastasis and multiple atypical adenomatous hyperplasia/adenocarcinoma in situ. 
Additionally, the presence of well-circumscribed foci of homogeneous fat attenuation in the myocardium of patients with TSC was seen in the majority of patients with TSC usually located in the interventricular septum and the left ventricular wall. Fatty foci in patients with TSC appear to have unique CT characteristics with respect to location, attenuation, focality, absence of enhancement, and absence of invasive behavior that most closely resembles that of lipomas seen in other parts of the body.
In this patient, brain axial fluid-attenuation inversion-recovery image demonstrates focal areas of high signal intensity and enhanced CT image shows well-defined mass-like lesion with fat attenuation in the liver, compatible with angiomyolipoma. Considering all these features in the patient, these could be thought as manifestation of TSC.

","Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a pulmonary disease caused by inhalation of any of various antigens that trigger a diffuse inflammatory response in the small airways and pulmonary parenchyma. HP traditionally has been classified as manifesting in three phases: acute, subacute, and chronic. Acute HP is characterized by abrupt onset of symptoms within a few hours after heavy antigen exposure in a previously sensitized patient. Subacute HP is caused by intermittent or continuous exposure to low doses of antigen. Chronic HP results from very low-level persistent or recurrent exposure to antigen and is differentiated from subacute HP by the presence of fibrosis. The classic histological HP triad includes the following: chronic interstitial pneumonia with peribronchiolar accentuation; bronchiolitis; and non-caseating granulomas. Granulomas, however, are not present in all cases. CT findings of subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis are patchy or diffuse ground-glass opacity, small centrilobular nodular opacities, lobular areas of decreased attenuation (mosaic attenuation).
 Our patient lived in an old house with a basement and the symptoms started when she had to clean the moldy basement by herself. After treatment with antibiotics and steroid the symptom resolved and the centrilobular and diffuse ground-glass opacities on CT scan dramatically improved. When she returned to her home, the symptoms recurred. After, she moved out, and the symptom resolved, and CT finding were normalized.
 Transbronchial lung biopsy was performed during the admission period. Inflammatory cells in the thickened interstitium, focal scattered granulomas with multinucleated giant cells, and patchy scattered fibroblastic plugs in alveolar sac were detected and suggest hypersensitivity pneumonitis.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1377-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1377-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1377-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1377-4.jpg']",113,"['correct:91/113', 'diff:12/113']"

","Hydrostatic edema is usually bilateral and symmetric.

Unilateral or asymmetric edema may result. The most common cause of unilateral edema is the decubitus position. Right upper lobe edema may be seen in patients with papillary muscle rupture and mitral regurgitation; this is caused by a jet of regurgitant blood directed into the right superior pulmonary vein.

Fig 2-5. CT scans reveals multifocal GGO and consolidation with interstitial thickening and some crazy-paving pattern areas in both lungs, mainly at dependent portions.
","Lipoid pneumonia can be either exogenous or endogenous in cause based on the source of the lipid. Exogenous lipoid pneumonia usually occurs when animal fats or mineral or vegetable oils are aspirated or inhaled, whereas endogenous lipoid pneumonia results from lipid accumulation within intra-alveolar macrophages in the setting of bronchial obstruction, chronic pulmonary infection, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, or fat storage diseases.
Radiologic findings include the pulmonary opacities with ground-glass or consolidative, bilateral, and segmental or lobar in distribution and predominantly involve the middle and lower lobes. CT can reveal areas of fat attenuation as low as -30HU within the consolidative opacities and nodules, a finding diagnostic of lipoid pneumonia. However, even though the attenuation of the opacities or nodules can be low at initial presentation, the presence of superimposed inflammation can be a confounding factor by increasing the attenuation so that the fat component becomes less conspicuous or obscured. In the chronic phase, architectural distortion and interlobular septal thickening with fibrosis could be accompanied due to the transposition of oils from the alveoli in the lung interstitium. Additionally, ground-glass opacities with associated interlobular septal thickening (crazy-paving pattern) with a basilar predominance have also been described.
The information of various ways that a patient can be exposed to lipid-containing material is essential in the diagnosis of exogenous lipoid pneumonia.

CT scans show a thin-walled cystic mass with internal fat attenuation in the visceral compartment.,"Mature cystic teratomas (dermoid cysts), the most common type of mediastinal germ cell neoplasms, contain well-differentiated tissues derived from at least two of the three germ cell layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). These lesions most commonly occur in young adults and are usually detected in the anterior mediastinum, with only 3–8% observed in the posterior mediastinum. They are histopathologically characterized by the formation of cysts, which are usually lined by tall, mucus-secreting epithelial cells. 
	A large anterior mediastinal mass with a well-defined wall and predominant cystic component is highly suggestive of a mature cystic teratoma. Radiographically, a mature cystic teratoma usually presents as a sharply marginated, round, or lobulated anterior mediastinal mass that extends toward one side of the midline. On computed tomography imaging, the tumor appears as a heterogeneous and well-defined mass with variable wall thickness that may show enhancement. Although they may contain all four tissue types, including soft tissue, fluid, fat, and calcium, fluid-containing cystic components are usually the most prominent. Teratomas present with an exclusively cystic component without fat or calcification in 15% of cases. A fat-fluid level within the mass is a highly specific finding, although it is less frequent. Most mature cystic teratomas are multilobular; however, unilocular cystic lesions are known to occur.

","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (EDS IV), the vascular type, is an autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by a single allele mutation in the COL3A1 gene coding for type III collagen. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the synthesis of abnormal type III procollagen molecules from cultured dermal fibroblasts or by identifying the mutation in the COL3A1 gene. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome clinically manifests with skin hyperelasticity and fragility, joint hypermobility, blood vessel fragility with bleeding diathesis, and poor tissue healing with delayed healing with tissue paper-like scarring. Respiratory system involvement is not common in EDS IV, but when present, pneumothoraces are the most common respiratory complications. Hemoptysis, bulla formation, cavitary pulmonary lesions, and fibrous pseudotumor have also been described. The most frequently observed CT finding was emphysema suggesting alveolar wall rupture. Other pulmonary manifestation of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV is predominantly characterized by ground-glass opacification with occasional consolidation on CT. Very few references are available on the pulmonary radiological manifestations of this rare syndrome, but they seem to be triggered by the spontaneous formation of lung lacerations (caused by systemic tissue fragility), which may progress to bruising, cavitary nodules, fibrous nodules, and finally nodules with metaplastic ossification.

On surgical specimen, the mass reveals extramedullary hematopoiesis.
The most common manifestation of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) in the chest is paraspinal masses, which are typically discovered incidentally. Paraspinal masses are the most common site of EMH after hepatosplenomegaly and the most common site to present as a mass. Thoracic masses in the chest are frequently associated with thalassemia. The thoracic paraspinal masses of EMH are typically bilateral, smooth-surfaced, soft-tissue masses that contain areas of fat attenuation and do not calcify. The presence of fat attenuation within the masses most likely represents non-active lesions (akin to yellow marrow), whereas enhancement is more likely to be present in actively haematopoietic masses (akin to red marrow). Paravertebral masses are much more common in the thorax than in the abdomen or pelvis. The differential diagnosis of masses in the posterior mediastinum is led by neurogenic tumours and lymphoma, which can often have a similar appearance. Unlike lymphoma, EMH will present with bilateral masses and no soft-tissue connection or isthmus between the two masses. Neurogenic tumours are more commonly associated with osseous erosion. Castleman's disease is an additional possible differential diagnosis; however, the heterogeneity of masses associated with EMH is a key discriminator.

","Soft-tissue hemangiomas are benign vascular neoplasms that are thought by most physicians to be congenital in origin, although some authors have theorized that they represent a proliferation of vascular elements resultant from prior trauma. Soft-tissue hemangiomas that originate within skeletal muscle (intramuscular hemangiomas) are relatively uncommon and account for only 0.7% of all reported hemangiomas. Even less common are hemangiomas that occur in the chest wall. 
The imaging of soft-tissue hemangiomas typically begins with conventional radiography. Phleboliths are the only conventional radiographic finding helpful in diagnosing soft-tissue hemangioma. CT can demonstrate the characteristic fatty appearance of the tumor and occasionally reveal a phlebolith, which is specific to soft-tissue hemangiomas. Soft-tissue hemangiomas have a characteristic MR appearance. Typically, T1-weighted MR images demonstrate a soft-tissue mass of intermediate signal intensity with interspersed areas of high signal intensity that can appear lacy and correspond to areas of fatty proliferation. T2-weighted images typically demonstrate a predominantly hyperintense mass with interspersed areas of low to the intermediate signal intensity that is representative of hemosiderin deposition, fibrous septa, and/or smooth muscle. Small, round areas of low signal intensity depicted with any sequence may represent phleboliths or areas of signal void secondary to high-velocity blood flow within the vascular channels. Contrast material enhances numerous vascular channels throughout the vascular lesion.

","Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse hemorrhage without endobronchial lesions. Bronchoalveolar Lavage was done at RUL anterior segmental bronchus, and the color of the fluid became more sanguineous during the three sequential lavages. The patient was diagnosed to have diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome causing respiratory failure. Suspicion of DAH could be difficult, as symptoms and radiologic findings are nonspecific. Hemoptysis is absent for up to one-third of the patients. Once the diagnosis is established, the underlying cause must be established in order to initiate treatment.
Radiologic findings are similar to the other disease with acute alveolar filling processes. The exact pattern may vary depending on the underlying causes. In the acute phase, lobular or lobar ground-glass opacities to predominant consolidation could be demonstrated due to subtotal alveolar filling with blood. In 2-3 days, intralobular lines and smooth interlobular septal thickening may appear, sometimes giving rise to a crazy-paving pattern. Interstitial fibrosis can appear due to severe repeated hemorrhage.
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) should be performed to establish the clinical diagnosis of DAH and to exclude infections. Progressively hemorrhagic BAL in serial samples is diagnostic of DAH but not the underlying cause. Surgical lung biopsy could be required to find out the cause of the disease if serologic testing or clinical history is uncertain. Pulmonary capillaritis is the most typical histologic finding of DAH, whose appearance consists of an interstitial neutrophilic predominant infiltration, fibrinoid necrosis, and leukocytosis.

Chest CT demonstrates multiple pleural masses in right hemithorax. PET/CT depicts increased FDG uptake in lung and pleural lesions.,"Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EH) is a rare vascular tumor, originating from vascular endothelial or pre-endothelial cells. This low- to intermediate-grade sarcoma may involve the liver alone (21%), liver and lung (18%), lung alone (12%), or bone alone (14%), and can be aggressive, even resulting in systemic metastasis. Pulmonary EH is four times more common in women than in men and is often detected incidentally.
 EH in the thorax involves not only the lungs but also the pleurae and the mediastinum. In the lungs, EHE usually presents as multiple lung nodules. When the disease presents as an isolated pleural lesion, it typically exhibits pleural effusion and pleural nodules or thickening and simulates malignant pleural mesothelioma. Extrathoracic organ involvement includes the liver, long bones, spine, and soft tissues in the body.
The prognosis is very variable, with survival ranging from less than one year up to 30 years. There is no established standard treatment of choice; Surgery and/or chemoradiation therapy could be considered, depending on intrathoracic tumor spread and systemic metastases.

","ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus antigens and is usually caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. ABPA is typically seen in patients with long-standing asthma or cystic fibrosis. It is believed that the Aspergillus-specific IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reaction and the specific IgG-mediated type III hypersensitivity reactions play an important role in the pathogenesis of ABPA.
Diagnostic criteria include the presence of asthma, peripheral blood eosinophilia, an immediate positive skin test for Aspergillus antigens, increased serum IgE levels, and pulmonary opacity on chest radiographs.
CT findings include mucoid impaction and bronchiectasis involving predominantly the segmental and subsegmental bronchi of the upper lobes, along with centrilobular nodules or branching linear structures. In approximately 30% of patients, the impacted mucus is highly opaque or demonstrates frank calcification at CT.
The differential diagnosis includes other causes of mucoid impaction such as endobronchial lesions, bronchial atresia, bronchiectasis, and bronchial asthma.

","Malignant neoplasm is a rare complication of chronic empyema. Various malignant cell types can be associated with chronic empyema including malignant lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, malignant mesothelioma, and various sarcoma.
Among them, malignant lymphoma is the most common cell type (pyothorax associated lymphoma; PAL) and the most are non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of exclusively B-cell phenotype. 

PAL is usually secondary to iatrogenic pneumothorax for the treatment of tuberculosis. The development of PAL is triggered by a longstanding empyema lasting for more than 20 years after pneumothorax treatment. The current pathophysiologic understanding of the disease suggests that both chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection and immunocompromised conditions from long-standing inflammation due to chronic empyema may be the causative mechanism of the development of PAL.

PAL manifests as a lenticular or crescent-shaped soft tissue mass straddling the thickened pleura at the margin of a coexistent empyema cavity. It has a tendency to invade adjacent structures including the chest wall, rib, lung, and diaphragm. Heterogeneous attenuation due to necrosis, simulating empyema necessitates, is common in PAL (which is uncommon in the other types of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma).

There are previous reports of distant involvement of PAL including cervical, mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes; superficial lymph nodes; adrenal glands; liver; stomach, kidneys; central nervous system; spleen; small intestine, and pancreas.

Differential diagnoses of PAL are benign complications of chronic empyema including empyema necessitates and other rare empyema-associated malignant tumors such as mesothelioma, angiosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.

The prognosis of PAL is poor.

","Thoracic involvement of systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) includes pleura effusion or pleural thickening (40-60%), pulmonary hemorrhage (14%), diaphragmatic dysfunction (18%), fibrosing alveolitis (3%)-subpleural reticular opacities, and lupus pneumonitis (rare). Acute lupus pneumonitis is a rare SLE manifestation, reported in 1-4% of patients. The clinical features are fever, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and hypoxemia. It may be difficult to distinguish acute lupus pneumonitis from severe infection and ARDS. It is usually prudent to treat for infection initially, and once the infection has been ruled out, the clinician needs to think about the possibility of pulmonary involvement of SLE and treat with immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment mainly consists of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine. Mortality has been described as being up to 50% in a case series.
Acute lupus pneumonitis manifests as unilateral or bilateral patchy consolidation, typically in the lung bases, resulting from alveolar capillary injury leading to edema and hemorrhage. An accompanied pleural effusion is often present. Focal consolidation from acute pneumonitis may be difficult to differentiate from that due to pneumonia, and, given that infection is more common, it is imperative to exclude an infectious source with both clinical and laboratory evaluation before considering lupus pneumonitis. Unlike other collagen-vascular diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma, chronic interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis occur in less than 3% of SLE patients and may represent sequelae of acute pneumonitis.

","Epipericardial fat necrosis can occur in various sites in an organism. It is common in the breast and has also been described in peripancreatic fat in cases of pancreatitis, in epiploic appendagitis, and in subcutaneous fat.
The pathogenesis of epipericardial fat necrosis is unknown. Trauma and ischemia are associated with fat necrosis in systemic adipose tissue. Acute torsion has been proposed as the cause of ischemic necrosis of the epipericardiac fat, although the presence of a vascular pedicle has been described in only two cases. It has also been hypothesized that increased thoracic pressure related to a Valsalva maneuver may produce an elevation of capillary pressure that could lead to hemorrhagic necrosis.
The higher spatial resolution of modern CT scanners allows better characterization of the lesion and orientation of the diagnosis. The main CT features in epipericardiac fat necrosis are an encapsulated fatty lesion with inflammatory changes such as dense strands, thickening of the adjacent pericardium, or both. These findings with chest pain are highly suggestive features of fat necrosis.

However, he was diagnosed with AIDS during examination, and PJP PCR test was positive. After Cotrim IV + Steroid Pulse therapy, the lesions improved completely.
","Pneumocystis jiroveci is an atypical fungus that causes pneumonia in immunocompromised human hosts, and rarely in immunocompetent individuals. The presentation of PJP in a patient with HIV infection is typically subacute, characterized by a slow onset of dry cough and dyspnea. PJP in patients without HIV infection presents as an acute illness associated with severe hypoxia and results in rapid respiratory deterioration and respiratory failure 
The radiographic findings of PJP are nonspecific, and in as many as one-third of infected patients they may be normal. The most common high-resolution CT finding of PJP is diffuse GGO with predominantly perihilar or mid zones. Other findings include crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, nodules, cysts and pneumothorax. Air cysts is a pneumatocele that occurs mainly in patients undergoing aerosolized prophylaxis and is usually placed in the upper lobes. If there are atypical imaging findings such as consolidation, small nodules, lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion, other superimposed infections should be considered. Overall, with prompt treatment, survival is good (50-95%).
The three-density pattern on chest CT is characterized by the mixed lung parenchyma of high, low and normal attenuation. This sign is considered to be highly specific for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but differentiation from other obstructive or infiltrative diseases is necessary. For example, sarcoidosis, atypical infection associated bronchiolitis such as mycoplasma pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis, or desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) may also manifest with the three-density pattern.

He underwent VATS biopsy and pathologic findings showed chronic granulomatous inflammation due to cryptococcal infection. ","Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous encapsulated yeast-like fungus that is found worldwide; particularly in soils that are contaminated with pigeon excreta and decayed wood. Inhalation of cryptococcal particles into the lungs is a route of pulmonary infection, and subsequent hematogenous dissemination may cause central nervous system infection. The infection usually affects immunocompromised patients, particularly those with an impaired cell-mediated immune response. Most immunocompetent individuals have mild or no clinical symptoms with isolated pulmonary involvement, otherwise more aggressive clinical and radiographic findings in immunocompetent patients. 
Pulmonary cryptococcal infection has a variety of manifestations from lung nodules to mass-like appearance. The most common CT findings in immunocompetent patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis were pulmonary nodules. The nodules were most often multiple, smaller than 10 mm in diameter, and well defined with smooth margins. Nodules most commonly involved less than 10% of the parenchyma and were distributed in the middle and upper lungs. Multiple nodules were most commonly bilateral. Masses, areas of consolidation, cases of lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions, and areas of cavitation occurred infrequently. Pulmonary cryptococcosis in AIDS patients tends to manifest itself as a disseminated thoracic disease with an interstitial lung pattern and lymph node enlargement as seen in imaging studies. Although clinical improvement can be achieved in all patients, radiological improvement is slow, even after antifungal therapy. Lastly, lung lesions may persist for a long time, showing a divergence from the clinical response.

","The patient underwent VATS lobectomy of left lower lobe. From the operative findings, the mass was adhered to left pleura and left hemidiaphragm and had filled with dark brownish mucoid materials. Then, it had finally diagnosed as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is a neoplasm of intermediate biologic potential that frequently recurs and rarely metastasizes. It is composed of myofibroblastic mesenchymal spindle cells accompanied by inflammatory infiltration of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. 
The etiology and pathogenesis of IMT are unknown, but several hypotheses have been proposed as an auto-immune mechanism or infectious origin. 30% of cases are closely related to recurrent respiratory infections, caused by several microorganisms such as Mycoplasma, Nocardia, Actinomycetes, Epstein Barr, and human herpes virus. Also, Coffin et al. found that about half of the IMTs have a clonal cytogenetic aberration which is involved in activation of the ALK-receptor tyrosine kinase gene. Their study reported that ALK reactivity may be a favorable prognostic indicator, and more likely to be associated with the atypical characteristics of IMTs.
Lung is one of the most common locations of IMTs. They account for around 50% of the benign pulmonary mass in children, representing only about 0.7% of all tumors of lung in general population.
Common clinical characteristics include unspecific respiratory symptoms, such as cough, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis and unspecific inflammatory symptoms as fever, malaise and weight loss.
The radiological presentation of lung IMTs is nonspecific. They usually appear as solitary, well-circumscribed peripheral lung masses, with predominance for the lower lobes. Calcification of the masses is unusual (about 15 %). It is not frequent, but it can also be multiple. On CT with intravenous contrast, they present a variable heterogeneous or homogeneous degree of enhancement pattern. Pleural effusion is seen in less than 10% and atelectasis in 8% of cases. Sometimes the tumor can extend towards the hilum, mediastinum, pleura or diaphragm.
Because of the rather non-specific and variable radiological findings, there are many differential diagnoses for pulmonary IMTs including such as primary lung carcinoma and pulmonary metastasis, and benign tumors such as granuloma, hamartoma, and hemangioma. In our case, the initial radiological differential diagnosis included mesenchymal origin sarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, and other malignant mass, such as lymphoma.
The treatment of choice for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons is complete resection. An incomplete resection increases the risk of recurrence. Corticosteroids are generally not useful in adults, although good results have been reported in children in cases of unresectable tumors or hilar and mediastinal invasion. Chemotherapy is useful in cases of multifocal, invasive lesions or in cases of local recurrence.

The diagnosis of the intraoperative frozen section was necrotizing granulomatous and the final pathologic report was revealed as necrosis with chronic inflammation and fibrosis. The Diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis was confirmed by positive TB-PCR.
Tuberculosis involving the heart is rare, accounting for only 0.5% of cases of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The main presenting finding is pericardial involvement, particularly in immunocompromised patients. A high prevalence of tuberculous-related pericarditis is reported in developing countries, and this disease accounts for up to 90% of cases when the disease is associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection. 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacilli can enter the pericardium by retrograde lymphatic spread, hematogenous dissemination, or, uncommonly, by direct contiguous spread from adjacent infected structures such as the lungs, pleura, and spine.
The primary sign of tuberculous pericarditis is the pericardial thickening of more than 3 mm in adults; this finding is seen in the majority of cases. CT demonstrates a thickened, irregular pericardium, frequently with associated mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Most patients have distention of the inferior vena cava to a diameter exceeding 3 cm; pleural effusions, typically bilateral; and deformities of the intraventricular septum. 
Pericardial abscess is a walled-off collection of pus within the pericardial space and most frequently occurs secondary to tuberculous pericarditis. The presence of predominant involvement of the right atrioventricular groove with features suggesting localized pericardial tamponade should make one suspect this entity. MRI has been shown to be more sensitive for the detection of small effusions, especially loculated effusions. The presence of high signal intensity on the T1-weighted images does strongly suggest a high proteinaceous content, indicating an exudate. The thickened pericardium shows a signal intensity equal to the myocardium on T1-weighted images, while low signal intensity lesions may be observed on the inner surface of the thickening pericardium, which reflects ferromagnetic elements after hemorrhage as well as fibrosis of the pericardium. Linear low signals depicted in the pericardial sac on T2 weighted probably represent strands of granulation tissue in past reports. Uniform tramline-like enhancement at the site of the fibrous hypertrophic parietal and visceral pericardia was reported. Although CT depicts either pericardial thickening or fluid collection, MRI may be helpful for evaluating the pericardial abscess and the diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis.

","Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an uncommon disease. Several synonyms, including histiocytosis X, eosinophilic granuloma, and Langerhans cell granulomatosis, have been used in the past, but the term Langerhans cell histiocytosis is now preferred. Despite the strong association with smoking, pulmonary LCH remains an uncommon disease, and accurate data of incidence and prevalence are problematic. With the widespread use of high-resolution CT today such surgical lung biopsy is performed much less frequently, and the diagnosis often is made based on a combination of clinical and imaging findings.
The high-resolution CT features in early disease are multiple ill-defined micronodules (1–5 mm in diameter) with a bronchiolocentric (centrilobular) distribution. Nodules may be profuse and predominate in the upper and middle lung zones with typical sparing of the costophrenic angles and tips of the lingula and right middle lobe. A lower zone predominance is unusual but has been described. Larger nodules (>1 cm in diameter) also can be seen and may warrant follow-up to evaluate for malignancy. Rarely, a solitary pulmonary nodule may be the only manifestation. As the disease progresses the nodules tend to cavitate, and a combination of cysts and nodules is characteristic. The distribution of cysts is the same as that of nodules, and the craniocaudal distribution of abnormalities may be convincingly shown on coronal and sagittal reformats. Recent studies have shown that positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning is a useful imaging modality to determine the extent of disease involvement in affected patients. Positive PET scans in pulmonary LCH usually occur in predominantly nodular lung disease, thick-walled cysts, bone, liver, and other extrapulmonary sites of involvement.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1397-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1397-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1397-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1397-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1397-5.jpg']",70,"['correct:4/70', 'diff:7/70']"

Meanwhile, there was an incidence rate of pyothorax-associated angiosarcoma among chronic pyothorax patients of 0.036 per 100 patients. Thus, the frequency rate of pyothorax-associated AS is supposedly over 3600-fold higher than that in normal population. The present study shows that chronic tuberculous pyothorax is one of the causes of AS development.

At multidetector CT, angiosarcomas are heterogeneous with internal regions of necrosis, hemorrhage, and vascularity. After intravenous administration of contrast material, enhancement of the vascular tissue may be seen.
At MR imaging, the typical finding is a soft-tissue mass with heterogeneous signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. Intense enhancement following the intravenous administration of gadolinium-based contrast material is common.
Discrete vessels may be identified at the tumor periphery. 
At FDG PET/CT, angiosarcoma demonstrates increased FDG uptake, although the uptake pattern may be heterogeneous owing to the presence of hemorrhage and/or necrosis.

Fig 2. Chest CT shows diffuse multifocal subpleural or peripheral ground-glass opacities and consolidations with mild smooth interlobular septal thickening in both lungs. Areas of consolidations with air-bronchogram are noted in both lower lobes, predominantly.
","On the history taking, the patient started smoking several weeks ago. He underwent bronchoscopy and the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid showed increased eosinophils (35%) and no other evidence of infection or allergic disease. He had no peripheral eosinophilia on blood tests. A follow up chest radiography 3 days after corticosteroid treatment showed that infiltrates in both lungs have been cleared (Figure)
Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is an uncommon acute respiratory illness of varying severity that includes a presentation as acute respiratory distress syndrome with a fatal outcome. AEP may be idiopathic, but identifiable causes include smoking and other inhalational exposures, medications, and infections. The pathogenesis of AEP is poorly understood but likely varies depending on the underlying cause. Airway epithelial injury, endothelial injury, and release of IL-33 are early events that subsequently promote eosinophil recruitment to the lung; eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation appear to mediate subsequent lung inflammation and associated clinical manifestations. Crucial information for the diagnosis is the demonstration of pulmonary eosinophilia in the BAL fluid and the exclusion of other disease processes that can present with acute pulmonary infiltrates. Although peripheral blood eosinophilia at initial presentation may be a clue in suggesting the diagnosis of AEP, it may be absent or delayed, especially in smoking-related AEP. 
Chest radiographic findings of AEP have been reported as bilateral diffuse infiltration with a non-segmental distribution in previous studies. Bilateral areas with GGO and interlobular septal thickening are the most common findings on CT. Bilateral areas of air-space consolidation and thickening of bronchovascular bundles are also seen in more than half of AEP cases. The distribution and zonal predominance are predominantly random or peripheral predominance. Poorly defined air-space nodules or pleural effusion can be seen in some cases.
Optimal management of AEP depends on the recognition and elimination of the underlying cause. The cessation of exposure to the inciting agent (e.g., smoking), and glucocorticoids represent the mainstay of treating AEP of noninfectious origin. If AEP is recognized and treated in a timely manner, the prognosis is generally excellent, with prompt and complete clinical recovery, even in those patients manifesting acute respiratory failure.

The mass is 7.3 cm and shows heterogenous enhancement in contrast-enhanced CT with no chest wall invasion on axial (Fig. 3) and coronal (Fig.4,5) images. In MRI, the mass has T1 hypointense signal with heterogeneous enhancement, heterogeneous T2 signal, and restricted diffusion (Fig. 6,7). The mass shows mild hypermetabolism (SUVmax=1.86) on 18F-FDG PET/CT scan (Fig 8).","The tumor was resected with LUL. The tumor originated from LUL apex visceral pleura, showed no invasion to around structures, and its capsule was intact. The pathologic diagnosis was solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura, low risk (total score 2: patient age>55 (score 1), tumor size (score 1), mitosis (score 0), tumor necrosis (score 0)).

Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are rare fibroblastic mesenchymal tumors. They can develop in any organ due to their spindle cell origin. The tumor is currently defined by the presence of NAB2-STAT6 gene fusions. 

Most SFTs have low mitotic counts and show little nuclear pleomorphism. The presence of mitotic figures (greater than 10 per high power field), necrosis, infiltrative growth pattern, and large size is associated with aggressive (malignant) behavior. Age above 55 years is also a risk factor.

Most SFTs grow slowly and form large masses, which could be asymptomatic or cause variable compression symptoms depending on the tumor size and location. Large SFTs are associated with paraneoplastic syndromes. Secretion of insulin-like growth factor 2 by the neoplastic cells may result in refractory hypoglycemia (Doege-Potter syndrome). More rarely, IGF2 production can produce an acromegaly-like syndrome. Thoracic lesions may be associated with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. 

Local or distant recurrence of SFTs has been documented in about 10–30% of cases with 10–40% of recurrences reported after 5 years from tumor resection. Recurrence after 15 years is rare. Metastases most commonly occur in the lung, but can also be found in the liver, brain and bones. 

On MRI, SFTs show hypo to isointense signal on T1-WIs, and variable signal intensity on T2-WIs. The T2 signal variability is linked to the relative amounts of mature fibrous tissue and myxoid or cystic degeneration within the tumor. Tumors with predominance of collagen and fibroblasts have low signal on T2-WIs, while degenerated lesions present high T2 signal. SFTs are highly vascular and usually show intense heterogeneous enhancement after intravenous gadolinium administration. Linear or rounded hypo-enhancing areas can also be seen within the lesions and are attributable to hypovascular collagenous stroma.

The role of PET/CT in the differentiation of benign from malignant SFTs is not well established.

Desmoid tumors (DFs; aggressive fibromatosis, deep musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis) are locally aggressive tumors with no known potential for metastasis or dedifferentiation. DFs are rare; The estimated incidence in the general population is 2-4 per million population per year. Most desmoids arise sporadically, although 5-15 percent are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis.
On CT, DF appears as a soft-tissue mass, either well-marginated, as most commonly seen in abdominal-wall tumors, or with ill-defined infiltrative margins, as seen in extra-abdominal or mesenteric tumors. DF shows variable attenuation, similar to or slightly higher than that demonstrated by skeletal muscle, with hyper- and hypoattenuation, probably reflecting collagen and myxoid elements, respectively. Enhancement is variable, with the majority of the masses demonstrating mild-to-moderate enhancement.
DF is not typically very metabolically active and often demonstrates standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of less than or equal to 4.8. However, increased uptake may occur in more cellular areas.
DFs have an unpredictable clinical course, and close observation is the preferred strategy for stable, asymptomatic primary or recurrent desmoids. Surgical resection has been the cornerstone of treatment for DF. The overall surgical strategy should also use function-preserving surgical approaches to minimize major morbidity (functional and/or cosmetic).

The patient underwent wedge resection and the pathologic examination confirmed the presence of pleuroparenchymal blastoma, type 1, regressed type.  
","Pleuropulmonary blastomas (PPB) are a rare, variably aggressive, childhood primary intrathoracic malignancy. In up to 25% of cases, the mass can be extrapulmonary with attachment to the parietal pleura. They are classified under sarcomatoid carcinomas of the lungs. Pleuropulmonary blastoma is encountered in childhood, mostly in the first years of life (90% in those between 0-2 years old). Pleuropulmonary blastoma is considered a form of pulmonary blastoma. It comprises both mesenchymal and epithelial components resembling fetal lung. Bilateral occurrence is extremely rare.

This classification is a continuum from the less malignant to the most malignant lesion:

type 1: lesions manifest as a single cyst or a multicystic lesion (often air-filled)
type 2: lesions show air- or fluid-filled cavities with possible air-fluid levels along with solid internal nodules
type 3: neoplasms are solid lesions that show low attenuation at CT and homogeneous or heterogeneous enhancement

In 2008, those “nonprogressed/regressed” cystic cases were described as type I regressed (PPB Ir) which were purely cystic tumors that lack a primitive cell component and signifies regression or nonprogression. It is characterized by the same cystic structure of type I, but the septa completely lack primitive cells and/or rhabdomyoblasts likely secondary to regressive changes. The age range for type Ir at diagnosis is broad ranging from infancy to adulthood (median diagnosis ages, 7–546 months). Patients with type Ir PPB can present with dyspnea from a pneumothorax or a large air-filled cyst, respiratory infections, or with the incidental discovery of a lung cyst. Type I/Ir pleuroparenchymal blastomas is challenging to differentiate from other congenital cystic lung malformations, and definite diagnosis is based on histopathology. Type 1 pleuropulmonary blastomas have a good prognosis. Up to 10% of cases of type I have been reported to progress to a higher grade.

Fig 4. Six years ago, the patients underwent chest CT scan. There was focal consolidation with internal air bronchogram in LLL. 
","Exogenous lipoid pneumonia was confirmed via wedge resection. The patient has taken squalene for several years. 
Lipoid pneumonia is an uncommon disease that results from accumulation of lipids in the alveoli and can be either exogenous or endogenous. Exogenous lipoid pneumonia usually occurs when animal fats or mineral or vegetable oils are aspirated or inhaled, whereas endogenous lipoid pneumonia results from lipid accumulation within intra-alveolar macrophages in the setting of bronchial obstruction, chronic pulmonary infection, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, or fat storage diseases. Symptoms include cough, mild fever, shortness of breath and chest comfort. Chest radiographs are usually nonspecific with bilateral lower lobe air space opacities, mixed alveolar and interstitial opacities. Occasionally, focal mass-like lesions could be shown. Lipoid pneumonia manifest as multifocal geographic GGO and consolidation with a predilection for dependent lungs on chest CT. Chest CT characteristically show low attenuation (-35 to -75 HU) indicating the presence of lipid deposition within consolidative areas. However, because inflammation or fibrosis may accompany the presence of the lipid material, the CT attenuation of the consolidation need not to be low. A crazy-paving pattern may also be seen and the crazy-paving pattern reflects intraalveolar and interstitial accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes in the alveolar lining. Since PET-CT shows increased uptake of 18F-FDG due to inflammatory component, it could be misinterpreted as malignancy.
Diagnosis can be difficult, since many patients do not recall a history of ingestion or inhalation of mineral oil substances. Bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsy, or open lung biopsy combined with a history of oil ingestion and radiographic studies are usually diagnostic. The mainstay of management in exogenous lipoid pneumonia is control and cessation of offending agent.

","Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a low-grade vascular tumor that typically manifests as one of four variants: classic KS, endemic (African) KS, iatrogenic (organ transplant–related) KS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)–related KS. KS is the most common tumor among AIDS patients, affecting a high percentage of these individuals, and is considered to be an AIDS-defining illness. Multiple organs can be involved by AIDS-related KS. KS has been linked with human herpes virus type 8 infection and other cofactors. 
Thoracic disease is found in about 45% of patients with cutaneous AIDS-related KS. Manifestations include parenchymal, tracheal, lymphatic, pleural, and chest wall abnormalities. Common clinical symptoms include chronic cough, dyspnea, fever, and hemoptysis. The typical purplish endoscopic appearance of tracheobronchial KS is helpful in developing the differential diagnosis. A characteristic CT finding in AIDS-related KS is the presence of bilateral and symmetric ill-defined nodules in a peribronchovascular distribution (flame-shaped lesions), usually exceeding 1 cm in diameter. Ground-glass opacities may be seen surrounding the nodules (“halo sign”). Other common findings include peribronchovascular and interlobular septal thickening, fissural nodularity, mediastinal adenopathies (eg, axillary, mediastinal, and hilar), and pleural abnormalities (eg, bilateral pleural collections and, rarely, pleural implants). 
AIDS-related KS of the liver is the most common intrahepatic neoplasm in patients with AIDS. Baseline CT findings include hypoattenuating nodules and irregular enlargement of the hilum and peripheral portal branches. After the injection of iodine-based contrast material, more hypoattenuating nodular lesions and periportal tissue can be visualized, most of which exhibit enhancement on delayed scans (4 –7-minute delay). Nodular lesions may appear iso- or hyperattenuating on delayed images and may be indistinguishable from multiple hemangiomas. 
Gastrointestinal AIDS-related KS compromise is the most common visceral involvement in disseminated disease, being seen in up to 50% of patients. AIDS-related KS can affect any level of the gastrointestinal tract from the oropharynx to the rectum, including the gallbladder. The duodenum is the most frequently affected site. The red-purple endoscopic appearance of lesions is helpful in developing the differential diagnosis, which may include lymphoma, opportunistic infections, hematogenous metastasis, polyps, and Crohn disease. Endoscopic biopsy may be negative because of the submucosal location of the tumor.

","The patient’s symptoms improved after using a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for a week.

Epipericardial fat necrosis (EFN) is an uncommon benign condition and usually presents as an acute pleuritic chest pain in previously healthy patients, which can mimic acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or acute pericarditis. EFN is characterized as a self-limited inflammatory process occurring inside the epipericardial fat, which is the tissue that connects the pericardial layer to the anterior thoracic wall. The etiology of EFN is still unknown, similar to other analogous conditions such as epiploic appendatitis and fat necrosis in the omentum and breast.
The chest radiograph is non-specific and might reveal an ill-defined opacity near the cardiophrenic angle on the side that pain is presenting, with or without pleural effusion.
Chest CT is the modality of choice for diagnosing EFN. EFN usually presents in CT as a round, encapsulated, fatty lesion with inflammatory changes such as dense strands, thickening of the adjacent pericardium or pleura. Pleural effusion can also be present at the time of diagnosis.
The treatment is conservative and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are usually sufficient to relieve the symptoms.

","Desmoid fibromatosis is a locally aggressive but non-metastasizing myofibrobalstic neoplasm with infiltrative growth and propensity for local recurrence. The majority of intrathoracic desmoid fibromatosis arise from the chest wall, but cases originating from the pleura, pulmonary parenchyma and mediastinum also have been reported. 
Intrathoracic desmoid fibromatosis most often arise in adulthood and show an equal sex distribution. It may cause pain, dyspnea, and kyphoscoliosis or may be detected as an incidental radiologic finding.
The etiology of tumor includes genetic factors and some cases may be associated with prior trauma.

[Pathogenesis]
The majority of cases (as many as 95%) are sporadic, resulting from somatic mutations in CTNNB1; a smaller subset occurs in patients harboring germline APC mutations (Gardner syndrome).

[Imaging findings]
Desmoid-type fibromatoses are commonly intermuscular masses of deep soft tissue. On CT scan, it shows soft tissue mass of variable attenuation and enhancement. It can appear both sharp margin and indistinct margin with infiltration into adjacent structures. Necrosis and calcification is rare.
On MRI, it appears iso to mildly hyperintense relative to muscle on T1- weighted images, and iso- to hyperintense relative to muscle on T2-weighted images. The unusual characteristic of heterogeneous, bandlike low-signal intensity areas on T1- and T2-weighted images is a distinguishing feature of desmoid-type fibromatosis. The nonenhancing hypointense bands are thought to represent areas of increased fibrosis composed of a higher degree of collagen content. A higher percentage of cellularity (as opposed to collagen) correlates with higher signal intensity on T2-weighted and short inversion time inversion recovery images. On PET-CT scan, it shows mild FDG uptake. 

[Prognosis and prediction]
The clinical behaviors of desmoid fibromatosis is unpredictable. The recurrence rates as high as 33%. Magin status dose not consistently correlate with recurrence risk.

Fig4. 2 chamber cine MRI showed diffuse enlargement of the left atrial appendage with an intact pericardium (white arrow). It revealed slow mixing flow on real-time imaging. (*: LAAA)
","Left atrial appendage aneurysm (LAAA) is a rare heart anomaly caused by congenital dysplasia of the pectinate muscle or by acquired pathological conditions of the mitral valve or cardiac muscle. It is associated with life threatening complications and most patients require surgical treatment.
LAAA occurs in all ages, the mean age of presentation is 31±20 years (fetus at 28 weeks to 88 years). Clinical manifestation ranges from asymptomatic to palpitation, dyspnea, and chest pain. Physical examination is normal to cardiac murmur and irregular pulse. LAAA can also be classified as intrapericardial and extrapericardial depending on the location. The intrapericardial type is caused by weakness in the wall of the left atrium and/or appendage. The extrapericardial type is associated with pericardial defect through which the appendage can herniate and progress to aneurysmal dilatation. The extrapericardial type is known to have a better prognosis.
The most common accompanying abnormalities are atrial tachyarrhythmia and the formation of thrombus. Pathophysiologically, enlargement of the atrium provides a substrate in which an electrical signal is triggered or reentrant, causing atrial tachyarrhythmia. And trabeculation of left atrial appendage wall along with improper contraction by arrhythmia leads to blood stagnation and clot forming. Moreover, when the aneurysm becomes larger, it can cause mass effects that compress the left ventricle and left coronary artery, which result in cardiac dysfunction and myocardial ischemia. If LAAA induces volume overload in LA, it leads to LA myocardial remodeling and subsequent diastolic hear failure. 
The diagnostic tool is transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), enhanced chest (or cardiac) CT and enhanced cardiac MRI. On enhanced chest CT, dilated LAA can be easily diagnosed as LAAA and can be finded out accompanying complications such as intraluminal thrombus and/or compression of surrounding structures (left circumflex artery, great cardiac vein and the left phrenic nerve). On MRI, not only the cardiac function, but also the dynamic mass effect of LAAA during the cardiac cycle and degree of fibrosis can be observed.

Radiographs may show nonspecific widening of the mediastinum, with distortion and obliteration of normally recognizable mediastinal interfaces or lines. Findings can be quite subtle and the extent of mediastinal involvement is frequently underestimated.
CT findings show an infiltrative mass of soft tissue attenuation. The mass obliterates normal mediastinal fat planes and encases or invades adjacent structures. Fibrosing mediastinitis commonly affects middle mediastinal compartment, including both right and left paratracheal, subcarinal, and hilar areas.
On MR, fibrosing mediastinitis shows intermediate signal intensity on T1-WI and variable intensity on T2-WI. Foci of relative hypointensity may be seen on both T1- and T2-WI, caused by calcification or by dense fibrotic scar.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1423-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1423-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1423-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1423-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1423-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1423-6.jpg']",98,"['diff:1/98', 'semi:37/98']"

The prognosis of LIP is highly variable. Some patients may have an indolent or even an asymptomatic course while others may have complications, such as associated infections, pulmonary fibrosis. It has been considered a pre-neoplastic condition with a high likelihood of progression to lymphoma (3); however, immunohistochemical and molecular analyses indicate that malignant transformation is not common (4, 5).

Also, his father has a history of ruptured abdominal aorta.
The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. There are 13 subtypes, each with distinct mutations in various collagen-encoding genes and phenotypic manifestations. The vascular EDS (vEDS, type IV) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a single allele mutation in the COL3A1 gene encoding for type III collagen. The estimated prevalence for all EDS varies between 1/10,000 and 1/25,000, vEDS representing approximately 5 to 10% of cases. vEDS is known as the most malignant form of EDS because of the high likelihood of developing spontaneous blood vessel rupture from aneurysms, dissections, transmural tears and rupture of the uterus and bowel. Respiratory system involvement is not common in EDS IV, but when present, pneumothoraces are the most common respiratory complications. Emphysema, bullae, cavitary nodules, and fibrous nodules can be seen on a chest CT scan and are hypothesized to be caused by spontaneous rupture of the alveolar wall and the creation and organization of hematoma. The fragility and disruption of vessels and alveoli may cause hemorrhage and hemoptysis.

On pleural fluid analysis, amylase was increased. 603 IU/ L. (serum amylase 112 IU/L)","1.Introduction
Pancreaticopleural fistulas(PPF) are a rare complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis whereby enzymatic pancreatic fluid, either from a pancreatic pseudocyst or directly from a disrupted duct dissects into the pleural cavity. It can occur as a result of acute or chronic pancreatitis, trauma, iatrogenic pancreatic duct disruption, and congenital anomalies of pancreatic duct.
PPFs are thought to develop from leakage from ruptured pseudocyst or direct pancreatic duct leakage into pleural space via aortic/esophageal hiatus or through diaphragm. They may also erode the pleural lining and disrupt subpleural vessels, causing bleeding into pleural space

2.Clinical manifestation
 PPFs are seen predominantly in alcoholic middle-aged men, but only half of them have clinical histories of previous pancreatitis. Biliary obstruction is more common etiology in children. 
Pleural effusions are more commonly seen in the left side.(~75%) 

3. Diagnosis
Diagnosing PPF needs high clinical suspicion. Diagnosis can be established via thoracentesis with pleural fluid analysis, demonstrating exudative effusion with high amylase level. There is no definite cut-off point for amylase level, but typically it is above >1,000 IU/L and commonly above 10,000 IU/L. Other causes of amylase-rich pleural effusions include parapneumonia effusion, TB, esophageal rupture and malignancies like leukemia, lymphoma and gynecologic malignancies. But only PPF related effusions have the pancreatic-type amylase; other causes of amylase-rich pleural effusion will have the salivary type amylase of pleural effusion. It is confirmed by amylase isoenzyme analysis. 

4. Radiologic feature 
-Sensitivity of various imaging modalities to delineate the fistulous track.
CT: 47%, ERCP: 78%, MRCP: 80% 
-CT
Peripancreatic fluid collections were located along the fistulous tract that ascending upwards crossing diaphragm(mainly through hiatus) to the pleural cavity causing pleural effusion. 

-ERCP
It can be diagnostic and therapeutic at the same time. However, it is ineffective in anatomic anomalies of pancreatic ducts, severe ductal strictures or obstructions. Value of ERCP may improved by performing CT scan after endoscopy to determine the course of fistula filled with contrast medium

-MRCP
Noninvasiveness, possibility to detect the fistula even in case of severe strictures of the pancreatic duct

5.Treatment and prognosis
 Initial management of PPF include reduction of pancreatic stimulation with NPO and octreotide(a long-acting somatostatin analogue) to decrease pancreatic secretion. Medical treatment is successful in 31~65% of cases. However, it needs two to three weeks of medical treatment and it is often conjugated with chest tube placement or PCD to place the recurrent pleural effusion in that period. 
Conservative therapy is often unsuccessful, and endoscopic transpapillary nasopancreatic drain or endoscopic pancreatic stent is frequently required. 
 Surgical treatment if the last resort when medical and ERCP treatment fail. The main principle of surgical treatment is to form a pancreatic enteric connection to achieve adequate drainage of the pancreatic sections with or without pancreatic resection. The most common surgery reported in the treatment of PPF is distal pancreatectomy with pancreaticojejunostomy.

Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is not a usual feature of pulmonary nocardiosis. Immunocompromised patients tend to present with disseminated disease. Disseminated nocardiosis occurs through hematogenous spread from the lungs most commonly to the CNS, skin, and joints. Differential diagnosis for pulmonary nocardiosis includes other causes of lung consolidation, cavitation, and nodules such as other infections, vasculitis, and malignancy.
Treatment of pulmonary nocardiosis usually includes high-dose sulfonamide therapy. Surgical drainage is not typically required for pulmonary disease.

Fig 2-4. CT scans show multiple variable-shaped lung nodules in the bilateral lung parenchyma. The nodules occur most in the lower lobes and periphery. In the mediastinal window setting, several lung nodules have internal calcifications or cavitations.","Amyloidosis, a disorder of protein folding, is rare. It affects the respiratory tract in about 50% of cases. The most important proteins associated with respiratory tract disease are amyloid L and amyloid A.
There are three major forms of amyloidosis in the lower respiratory tract: tracheobronchial, nodular parenchymal, and diffuse parenchymal (alveolar septal, interstitial). The parenchymal nodules of localized pulmonary amyloid can be solitary or multiple and are usually fairly well-defined. Amyloid is often identifiable in the alveolar interstitium at the periphery of the nodule.
Pulmonary function tests may show evidence of restriction and impaired gas transfer in patients who have diffuse alveolar septal amyloidosis and air-trapping and fixed upper airway obstruction in those who have proximal tracheobronchial involvement.
In CT images, nodular primary parenchymal amyloidosis manifests as solitary or, less commonly, multiple nodules usually ranging from 0.5 to 5 cm in diameter. On occasion, nodular parenchymal amyloidosis may result in a large mass. Calcification is seldom evident on radiographs but is seen in 20% to 50% of nodules on CT. The nodules tend to be more common in the periphery of the lower lobes but may be seen anywhere in the parenchyma. Rarely, nodules cavitate. Cysts may occasionally be present adjacent to the nodules. Cysts and nodular amyloid deposits have been described most commonly in patients with Sjögren syndrome, with or without associated lymphoid interstitial pneumonia. The main differential diagnosis of the parenchymal nodular form of amyloidosis is granulomatous infection or primary or metastatic tumors.
The diagnosis of amyloidosis usually requires histologic confirmation. The diagnosis is based on demonstration of amyloid by Congo red staining, which produces characteristic apple-green birefringence under crossed polarized light. Nodular parenchymal amyloidosis is usually asymptomatic and remains stationary or progresses slowly. It usually has a good prognosis and seldom requires treatment.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1430-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1430-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1430-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1430-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1430-5.jpg']",88,"['correct:30/88', 'diff:23/88']"

The patient underwent computed tomography-guided lung biopsy, and the pathologic result was granulomatous inflammation with vasculitis. The serum Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (c-ANCA) test was positive.
","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is an uncommon necrotizing vasculitis that classically manifests as a clinical triad consisting of upper airway involvement, lower airway involvement, and glomerulonephritis. Because thoracic involvement is often predominant, chest radiographic findings are often the first to suggest the diagnosis. Common pulmonary radiologic findings include waxing and waning nodules, masses, ground-glass opacities, and consolidation. Airway involvement is usually indicated by circumferential tracheobronchial thickening, which can be smooth or nodular. Pleural effusion is the most common manifestation of pleural disease and can result from primary involvement or occur secondary to renal failure. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is a nonspecific finding and is usually reactive. Uncommon thoracic radiologic manifestations include involvement of the heart and great vessels.
Ocular and orbital manifestations are common in almost half of the patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, affecting every structure of the eye, from the eyelid and orbit to the retina, choroid, and optic nerve, with a wide range of severity.
Elevation of serum cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) titers, usually directed toward proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase (found in neutrophils), occurs in up to 90% of patients with active Wegener granulomatosis. The correlation between c-ANCA and Wegener granulomatosis has been well established. Although c-ANCA testing can aid in the diagnosis, a positive result is not conclusive. Negative c-ANCA test results are not sufficient to exclude the diagnosis, and biopsy remains the standard diagnostic method.

The consolidations showed homogeneous enhancement (average 70-80 HU) and air bronchogram. There were also multifocal small peribronchovascular nodules in both lungs. There were no significantly enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum nor pleural effusion.
","Primary pulmonary lymphoma (PPL) represents a monoclonal lymphoid proliferation affecting the lungs in a patient with no detectable extrathoracic lymphoma for at least 3 months after the initial diagnosis. PPL ranges from a relatively indolent MALT lymphoma to more aggressive forms of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These two entities make up the majority of cases of PPL, which is overall a rare disorder. Non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (NHL-B) is the most frequent type and accounts for roughly 80% of all PPL. The majority of these are MALT lymphomas, which are frequently associated with autoimmune diseases. DLBCL accounts for the majority of the other patients with PPL and it is characteristically seen in patients with underlying immunodeficiency, such as transplant patients on ciclosporin. The incidence of DLBCL may well be underestimated, as it could potentially spread rapidly from the lung into mediastinal and extrathoracic locations.
MALT lymphomas are usually asymptomatic and discovered as an incidental findings. They are typically indolent lesions and have a good prognosis. Immunocompromised patients with DLBCL are usually symptomatic with dyspnea, fever, and weight loss. Overall survival is poor and the prognosis is worse if there is an underlying disorder. Progression and relapse also occur much earlier in this group. DLBCL tends to be more diffuse and destructive, with 5-year survival rates ranging from 0–60% compared with 84–94% for MALT lymphomas.

There was a study evaluated the CT imaging findings in 21 patients with MALT lymphoma, and this group identified the following four radiological patterns of disease:
1.	single nodule or single consolidative opacity (33%)
2.	multiple nodules or multiple areas of consolidation (43%)
3.	bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis (14%)
4.	diffuse interstitial lung disease (10%).

","Immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) is an acute pulmonary edema that develops during scuba diving, snorkeling, breath-hold diving, or intense activities.
The pathophysiology of IPE is still incompletely understood. One of theories explains that during immersion in water, central redistribution of blood from the extremities occurs, and is augmented when the water is cold. The resulting engorgement of the central veins, heart and pulmonary vessels causes increased right sided intravascular pressures and increased pulmonary capillary pressure, and finally cause leakage of fluid and blood into the alveolar space.
Risk factors include age of more than 50 years, female sex, heart disease, excess pre-exercise fluid intake, use of tight wetsuits, and cold exposure.
Chest radiograph and CT show pulmonary edema without cardiomegaly.

- Leiomyomas are soft tissue tumors that originate from smooth muscles, usually occurring in the uterus, small intestine, or esophagus. Intrathoracic leiomyomas are extremely rare and are usually detected by chance during routine check-ups or diagnostic studies for other reasons.
- Primary extra-pleural leiomyoma is an extremely rare proliferation of smooth muscle origin arising in the extrapleural cavity of the lungs. It is a benign smooth muscle tumor with a low malignant potential but may increase in size with local invasion. Typical radiographic findings on CT demonstrate a well-defined solitary lesion, coursing from a few millimeters to several centimeters, with minimal invasion of adjacent structures. However, pathologic confirmation is needed for a definitive diagnosis. 
- When located in atypical regions such as our case, these tumors are generally benign and completely resectable due to the minimally invasive nature of the tumor.","['https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1436-1.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1436-2.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1436-3.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1436-4.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1436-5.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1436-6.jpg', 'https://kstr.radiology.or.kr/weekly/files/case-1436-7.jpg']",92,['semi:3/92']

Fig 6. Compared with the coronal CT scans performed 2 years later, tiny nodules and linear opacities slightly increased. 

The patient underwent bronchoscopic biopsy and the pathologic examination confirmed the presence of multifocal ossification.","Pulmonary ossification is an unusual condition of unknown etiology and has been recognized in the following 2 forms: granular (nodular) and dendriform. The nodular type of ossification has been linked to passive congestion due to chronic heart failure, mitral stenosis, and hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Dendriform pulmonary ossification (DPO) has been most often described in association with primary lung diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. DPO is less common than the nodular type.

DPO is classified along with nodular pulmonary ossification as a form of diffuse pulmonary ossification. DPO and nodular pulmonary ossification occur in very different clinical situations and have unique CT appearances. Nodular pulmonary ossification, in which ectopic bone is present in the alveolar spaces, occurs in the setting of chronically elevated pulmonary venous pressures particularly due to chronic mitral stenosis or left heart failure. Nodular pulmonary ossification represents pathologic ossification in areas of chronic airspace hemosiderosis and organizing pneumonia; histologically, the bone elements do not contain marrow elements (fat or hematopoietic cells). The CT appearance is that of small centrilobular nodules, often of high attenuation, with a lower lobe predominance that may coalesce. DPO is a process in which metaplastic ectopic bone is present within the lung. Pathologically, the bony deposits are in the alveolar walls and the peripheral interstitium, including the interlobular septa and subpleural and perifissural regions; the bony spicules form a contiguous branching pattern, resulting in a lattice-like appearance or dendrite. The CT appearance of DPO is characteristic, but there have been limited descriptions of CT findings in patients who do not have pulmonary fibrosis. Small nodules, several millimeters in diameter, are present in the peripheral interstitium (interlobular septa and subpleural and perifissural spaces) and form contiguous, branching structures resembling tree branches in the affected areas. The deposition of DPO correlates with the underlying structure of the parenchymal peripheral interstitium. Significant lobular distortion, traction bronchiolectasis, and honeycombing are absent. High attenuation, reflecting the underlying ossification, can be identified in some but not all nodules; microscopic ossification may not be visible on CT, and thin sections and maximum-intensity-projection images are helpful in the detection of small high-attenuation foci.
No specific treatment or management guidelines are published for patients with DPO  alone. Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies is a useful tool for diagnosing dendriform pulmonary ossification.

Serum P. Westermani IgE Ab (+) was positive.
","Pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis is a parasitic infection caused by lung flukes including Paragonimus westermani. The most common symptoms are intermittent hemoptysis or blood-tinged sputum and cough.
Paragonimiasis usually occurs from the ingestion of raw or improperly cooked freshwater crabs or crayfish. After ingested by humans, Paragonimus excyst in the small intestine, and the larvae penetrate through intestinal wall to gain access to the peritoneal cavity. Several weeks later, the organism travels through the diaphragm on its way to the pleural space. Next, they enter the lung, where they mature to adult flukes and produce cysts that contain eggs. Paragonimiasis typically results in single or multiple 1- to 4-cm cystic spaces containing reddish-brown mucinous fluid. When erosion occurs into draining airways, the contents of the cyst may be coughed up or may spread to other portions of the lung parenchyma and the result is exudative or hemorrhagic pneumonia.
Pleural or lung parenchymal lesions are commonly found on CT or chest radiographs, and radiologic manifestations of pleuropulmonary paragonimiasis vary with the stage of the disease. The characteristic CT features of pulmonary paragonimiasis are round low attenuation cystic lesions filled with fluid or gas. CT scan also showed air-space consolidation, nodules, worm migration track, and bronchiectasis. Pleural paragonimiasis manifests as focal pleural thickening, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, hemothorax, and empyema. Focal pleural thickening usually appears adjacent to parenchymal lesions, which can be helpful to diagnose paragonimiasis.

The cysts showed lobulated or multi-septated appearance. 
Fig 5. KUB CT scan shows an avidly arterial enhancing mass in the lower pole of the right kidney, suggestive of renal cell carcinoma.

In the present case, incidental right renal mass was detected on screening kidney ultrasonography and AP CT. Right partial nephrectomy was performed, and the diagnosis was papillary renal cell carcinoma. The diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dube(BHD) syndrome was confirmed by heterozygosis mutations in exon 11 of the folliculin (FLCN) gene.
","Birt-Hogg Dube (BHD) syndrome, initially described in 1977, is an uncommon autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the presence of skin fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts, and renal cancer. This condition is caused by germline mutations in the FLCN (folliculin) gene, which is located on chromosome 17p11.2 and encodes folliculin; the function of this protein is largely unknown, although FLCN has been linked to the mTOR pathway.
Radiologically, more than 80% of adult patients with BHD had multiple lung cysts, most often located in the lower, peripheral lung regions and along the mediastinum. The shape and size of cysts are variable. Cysts are predominantly located in the lower medial lung zone, and large cysts have a lobulated, multiseptated appearance, particularly those in the lower lungs. Cysts abutting proximal portions of lower pulmonary arteries or veins may also exist.
The histology of pleuropulmonary lesions in BHD is consistent with emphysematous changes. Despite the presence of multiple lung cysts, lung function is usually unaffected. Due to the propensity of cysts to rupture, affected individuals are predisposed to spontaneous pneumothorax (estimated 50-fold higher risk of pneumothorax than in the general population) with a high recurrence rate, approximately 80% with an average number of 3.6 episodes. The mean age of occurrence of the first episode of pneumothorax was between 30-40 years of age.
Differential diagnosis of cystic lung disease includes lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP), and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LAM, which may be associated with tuberous sclerosis, shows diffuse uniform thin-walled cysts in comparison with lung cysts in BHD. LIP, which may be associated with Sjogren’s syndrome or lymphoproliferative disorders, tends to have perivascular cysts in combination with ground-glass opacity. LCH, which is usually presented in smokers, has early centrilobular nodules sparing the costophrenic angle.

A huge lipiodol uptake and hepatocellular carcinoma are noted in the right hepatic lobe.","The complications of hepatic arterial chemoembolization include postembolization syndrome, with symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzyme levels. The incidence of pulmonary oil embolism was reported as 0.05-2.3%. However, lipiodol-induced pneumonitis following TACE is rare.
Although the mechanism of lipiodol-induced pneumonitis following TACE is still unclear, the most probable hypothesis for symptomatic lipiodol pneumonitis is pulmonary capillary leakage and edema caused by enzymatic degradation of lipiodol by lipases and formation of toxic unbound free fatty acids. 
In this case, it is suspected that the progression of lipiodol pneumonitis was induced by injected lipiodol migrating into the venous system through AV shunts located in the hypervascular HCC tumors. The characteristic radiographic findings are diffuse bilateral pulmonary consolidation and ground glass opacity with a high attenuating area, after TACE with iodized oil infused into the hepatic artery
The main therapy is supportive treatment with supplemental oxygen and systemic antibiotics. Steroid therapy can be considered to reduce inflammation caused by lipiodol, but the evidence for this is still weak.

Subependymal tubers are considered to be closely related to the neurologic manifestations of TS, including epilepsy, cognitive disability, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. 
Pulmonary involvement of TS includes lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH). Thin-section CT can demonstrate characteristic features of pulmonary LAM and can obviate lung biopsy. The typical CT finding is round, thin-walled cysts of variable size and contour. Generally, the distribution of the cysts is symmetric and uniform throughout the lungs. MMPH is a rare pulmonary disorder that can be associated with TS.

Osseous manifestations of TS include cystlike lesions, hyperostosis of the inner table of the calvaria, osteoblastic changes, periosteal new bone formation, and scoliosis. These osseous lesions can occur anywhere in bone, commonly in the calvaria, short tubular bones of the hand or foot, spine, and pelvis.

Pulmonary drug toxicity is a common and possibly underdiagnosed cause of acute and chronic lung disease. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent commonly used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. This drug is an iodine-containing compound that tends to accumulate in several organs, including the lungs. Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT) occurs in approximately 5% - 10% of patients usually within months of starting therapy. Although there is no correlation between the development of drug toxicity and the duration of therapy or total accumulative dose, the risk is increased if the daily maintenance dose is greater than 400mg and if the patient is elderly. Although the incidence of this complication has decreased with the use of lower doses of amiodarone, it can occur with any dose. 
Radiology plays a central role in diagnosis. Chest x-rays reveal patchy of diffuse infiltrates, which are commonly bilateral. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern is the most common manifestation of amiodarone-induced lung disease. Pleural inflammation is an accompanying feature and can manifest as pleural effusion. Organizing pneumonia (OP) pattern is less common and typically occurs in association with NSIP. Focal, homogeneous pulmonary opacities are typically peripheral in location and of high attenuation at CT due to the incorporation of amiodarone into the type II pneumocytes.
Patients usually have dyspnea, hypoxemia, exertional desaturation and sometimes weight loss. Diffuse crackles are heard on auscultation.
With early detection, the prognosis is good, with most patients improving after discontinuation of therapy and administration of corticosteroids. A minority of patients experience acute, severe lung injury resulting in death.

Clinical manifestation could vary depending on the involved organ: various symptoms including bone pain, neurological signs, exophthalmos, retroperitoneal fibrosis, or dyspnea could be clinical manifestations of this disease depending on affected organs.
Musculoskeletal involvement is most common, and multifocal extraskeletal involvement is seen in 30-50%. Pulmonary manifestation is not common, and the lungs are affected in about 25% of cases. On chest CT, symmetric reticular abnormality, interlobular septal thickening, and multifocal ground-glass attenuation, centrilobular nodules could be pulmonary manifestations of Erdheim-Chester disease. In addition, pleural and pericardial effusion, cardiomegaly, peri-aortic infiltration, infiltration along other vessels (i.e. pulmonary artery and superior vena cava) were reported as thoracic manifestations of Erdheim-Chester disease. These radiologic abnormalities similar to interstitial edema pattern did not usually show response to diuretics. In upper abdomen, kidney, and retroperitoneal infiltration were often reported. In contrast to retroperitoneal fibrosis, inferior vena cava, and pelvic ureters are typically spared in this disease. Optic nerve edema, proptosis, or impaired eyeball movement could be caused by retro-orbital infiltration.
There had been try to treat Erdheim-Chester disease with steroids, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, but treatment seemed to show little effect on this disease. Pulmonary fibrosis and cardiac failure are the most common cause of death.

Fig 2. Chest CT scanogram which was obtained with supine position shows ovoid-shaped mass-like opacity in right lower paratracheal area.
Fig 3,4. Precontrast and contrast-enhanced CT scans show 3.3-cm contrast-filling space along the course of azygos arch, which is compatible with azygos vein aneurysm
","- Very rare, only a few cases have been described in literature
- Cause: idiopathic (m/c), aplasia of inferior vena cava, portal hypertension, thrombosis, congenital
- Embryology: azygous arch is confluence of three embryologic veins (right supra cardinal vein, right posterior cardinal vein, and right anterior cardinal vein); therefore, it is prone to develop aneurysm
- Clinical manifestation: 
- Related to their morphological characteristics, and large saccular aneurysms tend to present with chest symptoms because of the mass effect in the mediastinum
- Sluggish blood flow through the saccular AVA allows slow sedimentation and accumulation of thrombi within the lumen, leading to partial or eventual total thrombosis and progressive gradual enlargement of the AVA.

- Chest radiograph
- Well-defined mass in the area of the right tracheobronchial angle or as an enlargement of the right upper mediastinum
- Size can be changed by upright position, deep inspiration, or performing Valsalva maneuver

- CT: 
- Primary modality for noninvasive diagnosis. 
- Poor enhancement of the azygos vein on CT may lead to misinterpretation of AVA as neurogenic tumors or lymphadenopathies.
- Additional delay scan with optimal venous enhancement is facilitates the diagnosis of AVAs with a patent lumen
- The different levels of contrast in the aneurysm were seen with the highest density in the most posterior part
- MRI: identify thrombus or organized hematoma

- Treatment: not established. Conservative management is preferred due to meticulous ligation of azygos system and need to prevent migration of thrombus and pulmonary thromboembolism during surgery or intervention.

Chest PA shows multiple nodular opacities in both lungs with a large amount of left pleural effusion. A mediastinal mass was also suspected.

Fig 2-5. CT scan reveals a 9.4cm necrotic mass at the anterior mediastinum with heterogeneous enhancing areas. Multiple necrotic pulmonary metastases were seen in both lungs, less than 3.5cm in size.
A large amount of left pleural effusion was also noted, resulting in passive atelectasis of left lung.
His alpha-fetoprotein level was 1.4 ng/mL (reference: 1.1–5.0 ng/mL). His beta-hCG level was 10803.0 mIU/mL (reference: 0–2.6 mIU/mL).
","Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant tumor that originates from syncytiotrophoblasts. Primary choriocarcinoma of the mediastinum is defined as a choriocarcinoma in the mediastinum without a primary gonadal lesion or metastatic retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Primary choriocarcinoma of the mediastinum is extremely rare, and the diagnosis of the primary choriocarcinoma is challenging. Patients with primary choriocarcinoma are usually young men between 20 and 30 years of age. The main symptoms of primary mediastinal choriocarcinoma include dry cough, hemoptysis, gynecomastia, and chest pain. Chest computed tomography shows a large irregular shaped mass with central necrosis, hemorrhage, or cyst formation in the anterior mediastinum. Early hematogenous metastases to the lung, liver, and brain are common. 
Trophoblastic tumors such as choriocarcinoma display three major characteristics of trophoblastic tissue: the tendency to invade blood vessels, rapid proliferation, and rich vascularity. These features account for the hemorrhagic event of metastatic choriocarcinoma such as hemoptysis and hemothorax.
Serological examination demonstrates a high beta-hCG level. The prognosis of primary mediastinal choriocarcinoma is poor even after combination chemotherapy.
